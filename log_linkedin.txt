[u'Although I didn\'t formally sign an NDA I did agree to not talk about details on blogs or forums. That said I can only discuss in general terms. The questions were really not what I was expecting. There were two questions and neither of them required data structures or even an algorithm. Really just a standard coding question requiring some logic, analysis, and OO design but nothing fancy. Alas, for reasons beyond me the interviewer did not like how I answered the questions. Google does not provide any feedback on why you were rejected beyond a standard copy/paste response from the recruiter. On a side note- the interviewer didn\'t ask a single question about me or seem to care in the slightest. "Just another day, another interview" kind-of attitude. Which I guess is to be expected from them, but kinda depressing from the interviewee perspective. Afterwards I went through the interview minute-by-minute in my head and tried to guess what the interviewer was looking to see. Obviously it\'s a lot easier to come up with a great design when you are not under pressure. So no pearls of wisdom from me how I would do it differently since I felt I was very well prepared. I guess it\'s partially the luck of the draw, and the mood of the person doing the screening. When they have the full day of interview at least there needs to be a consensus from several interviewers. In the screening stage you get only one chance and one persons opinion to get you through the door. \xa0']

[u"4.The phone interview : (in Chinese mandarin) The interviewer called and first started with my past works and asked me to introduce my projects that is special. I talked about around 2 projects and he would ask some questions according to what I said. I think he cares does the project relate to internet or cloud application, but unfortunately I did not involve too much. After that he asked me two technical questions. I'm not allowed to expose the detail about the technical questions as the HR mentioned in the email. The first question is to write a code on a Google Doc that we shared. It was not too difficult. I think everyone can do it well as long as he(she) has practiced to write codes and review basic algorithms and data structures. Though I was too nervous and made some mistake and said a lot of nonsense. After I finished most part, he asked me could I further optimize it. I didn't figure out any but just during the time I guessed around he pointed out the way he thought. The second question was an open question. I told him my approach and he asked for more detail. And he pointed out the disadvantage about my approach. And after that he asked is there any other approach in my mind. I tried hard to think about another and he also discussed with me the trade off of. During the whole process, the interviewer was silent and made me thought that the phone was disconnect(my cell phone does that many times). I think maybe he was waiting for me to say more, discuss more or some better answers. Too bad I was really nervous and couldn't think too much. \xa0"]

How does the floating point numbers are represented in binary? 3. How to add two floating point numbers in binary? The answers to these questions lie in the The IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic (IEEE 754) and you can find sources online.

It went less than ideal with the first interviewer because I stumbled a few times while attempting to design a solution to the graph traversal question. Once I wrote a solution that I was pretty happy with, he noticed a flaw and we walked through an example where my solution did not work.

[u"I do take my NDA seriously, but in general terms: the interview questions at Google are extremely difficult and often very tricky. With that said, contrary to popular opinion, they are not necessarily any harder than the questions that any tech company with high standards would ask. Know your data structures and algorithms back to front; be prepared for questions as high-level as very general OOP design problems and as low-level as bit manipulations; and know your resume cold, because every interviewer was interested in at least one item on it. I HIGHLY recommend finding a copy of at least one coding interview book (Cracking the Coding Interview, Programming Interviews Exposed, and Design & Analysis of Algorithms served me well) and tackling the problems in it -- they will give you a good idea of what to expect. I will say that I had never seen any of the questions I was asked in my Google interviews (whereas the rest of the industry seems to recycle the same 20 questions over and over), but my practice with general interview-style coding questions was extremely useful nonetheless.

There are a variable number of reviewers, delimited by commas; if there are no reviewers, that line is absent from the file. There are a variable number of edited files in the commit, each receiving its own line. The time/date is when the commit was submitted. First design a graphical model for all of the commit data. Then describe how this model is updated when a new commit is generated.

[u' Questions were simple (same as described in glassdoor). Interviewer called on time, but didn\'t introduce himself. Directly jumped into questions (lags professionalism). There was no NDA. So, I think I can share the questions, 1) Search for "WordDistanceFinder linkedin". http://www.careercup.com/question?id=5725709041401856 2) Search for "TwoSum with test()/store()" methods. https://github.com/fcarriedo/algorithms/blob/master/exercises/twosumtest/TwoSumTest.java I discussed and coded more than two solutions for both problems. Wrote bug free code (verified my code after the interview in other websites). My mistakes: 1) I explained that we can use Set instead of HashMap verbally. I didn\'t type it in the editor. Looks like the lazy interviewer didn\'t make a note on that. Seems hiring committee raised concern on data structures (actually I used HashMap to support future enhancement - again didn\'t type that in the editor). 2) I didn\'t add comments in the code - Its an interview, don\'t expect someone to type comments - thats why I was explaining. 3) Used short variable names (asked interviewer is short notation fine with him... i.e., Used "idx" instead of "index". He was fine with that). Again I didn\'t mention that in the editor. Based on above three mistakes, the hiring committee said they\'ll consider me for Sr. software engineer. but definitely not for Staff Engineer. That too after another PS. Now I\'m wondering whether I\'ve to proceed my candidature with LinkedIn (I\'ve an offer for a director level position with another $3B company). I\'ve taken more than 100 interviews for my company. But this experience disappoints me. Advice to LinkedIn: Please give trainings to your interviewers. Make sure you collect right data points about your candidates (either ask your interviewer type a detailed feedback, or you talk to the interviewer). Because what you see is not the complete picture of the truth. My advice: Whatever you want to convey in a phone screen, make sure you type them in the editor. \xa0']

[u'Mostly personality-related questions like "What is the biggest challenge you\'ve overcome?" \xa0']
[u'There were two and they both happened during the live-debugging portion of the interview. All of the live debugging questions revolved around a simple website that had something broken in it. You were to fix the brokenness to be able to move on to the next page. In total there were 4 questions, each getting progressively more difficult to debug. The first question was a simple permissions problem on a file being requested by the client. The ownership of the file (a blank text file) was too restrictive, so it was raising an error. You could verify this in the apache web logs. The second error was due to a permission problem too, however this time the file was hidden in a sub directory of the main web site. You could only determine this by looking at the apache configuration file to see that the shtml file was located somewhere else. After that, change the permissions to fix. The third was a head scratcher. The filename in question was raising a 500 error and showing urlencoded characters in the filename in the web log. Looking at the name of the file on disk though, showed nothing out of the ordinary. It turns out that the unicode representations for the characters in the file name are printed in the terminal as english ascii characters. The only way you can tell that this is the case is to open the file and do a search for the filename itself and see if it matches. For example, if the correct filename is called "challenge1.shtml" you can search for that exact string but NOT find the unicode version of it. Once you find the incorrect file name, delete it and type the correct file name (in this case "challenge3.shtml" into the file and the page works. The final question was a segfault occurring in apache. It resulted in no information being returned to the client. You could see this occurring in the apache web logs as well as the Chrome tools. The apache web logs noted that a core file was dumped. This challenge required that you know a little bit about gdb and C programming. Basically, you need to run the core dump through gdb. gdb /path/to/apache /path/to/core/dump It will spew out a lot of stuff. In particular, it mentions that there is something happening in an apache module; mod_rewrite or something...it doesnt really matter. The output also points to the C source file for that module which is, conveniently on disk. Open that file in vi and jump to the line number mentioned in the gdb output (line 1861 or something). There you will see that if the filename matches challenge4.shtml to SIGSEGV; there\'s your smoke gun. They dont ask you to fix the final challenge, only to explain what the strstr is doing. The error in question basically looks like this if (strstr($r-&gt;filename, "challenge4.shtml") != NULL) { SIGSEGV } Just point out to them that, yeah, it\'s segfaulting when I ask for that file. \xa0', u'There was a paper presented to you with a number of nagios alerts and you had to rate them in the order you would approach fixing them. For example, one of them was a production host being 100% offline. Another was an environment alert about an entire cab that was overheating.

[u'Asked what I saw myself doing 5 years from now. \xa0']
[u'The presentation is the tricky step. The briefing for it was very light touch. LinkedIn colleagues offered many opportunities to discuss about it before the presentation itself. However the final overall impression I got was that the presentation was about the big picture, focusing on my abilities to explain a solution to an audience, to articulate ideas and rationale around a business case, to create a simple yet compelling presentation deck, to demonstrate confidence around technical topics at high level. During the presentation however, it became clear that the audience were technically skilled and were looking for the extra level of details.

[u' Questions were simple (same as described in glassdoor). Interviewer called on time, but didn\'t introduce himself. Directly jumped into questions (lags professionalism). There was no NDA. So, I think I can share the questions, 1) Search for "WordDistanceFinder linkedin". http://www.careercup.com/question?id=5725709041401856 2) Search for "TwoSum with test()/store()" methods. https://github.com/fcarriedo/algorithms/blob/master/exercises/twosumtest/TwoSumTest.java I discussed and coded more than two solutions for both problems. Wrote bug free code (verified my code after the interview in other websites). My mistakes: 1) I explained that we can use Set instead of HashMap verbally. I didn\'t type it in the editor. Looks like the lazy interviewer didn\'t make a note on that. Seems hiring committee raised concern on data structures (actually I used HashMap to support future enhancement - again didn\'t type that in the editor). 2) I didn\'t add comments in the code - Its an interview, don\'t expect someone to type comments - thats why I was explaining. 3) Used short variable names (asked interviewer is short notation fine with him... i.e., Used "idx" instead of "index". He was fine with that). Again I didn\'t mention that in the editor. Based on above three mistakes, the hiring committee said they\'ll consider me for Sr. software engineer. but definitely not for Staff Engineer. That too after another PS. Now I\'m wondering whether I\'ve to proceed my candidature with LinkedIn (I\'ve an offer for a director level position with another $3B company). I\'ve taken more than 100 interviews for my company. But this experience disappoints me. Advice to LinkedIn: Please give trainings to your interviewers. Make sure you collect right data points about your candidates (either ask your interviewer type a detailed feedback, or you talk to the interviewer). Because what you see is not the complete picture of the truth. My advice: Whatever you want to convey in a phone screen, make sure you type them in the editor. \xa0']

[u'Mostly personality-related questions like "What is the biggest challenge you\'ve overcome?" \xa0']
[u'There were two and they both happened during the live-debugging portion of the interview. All of the live debugging questions revolved around a simple website that had something broken in it. You were to fix the brokenness to be able to move on to the next page. In total there were 4 questions, each getting progressively more difficult to debug. The first question was a simple permissions problem on a file being requested by the client. The ownership of the file (a blank text file) was too restrictive, so it was raising an error. You could verify this in the apache web logs. The second error was due to a permission problem too, however this time the file was hidden in a sub directory of the main web site. You could only determine this by looking at the apache configuration file to see that the shtml file was located somewhere else. After that, change the permissions to fix. The third was a head scratcher. The filename in question was raising a 500 error and showing urlencoded characters in the filename in the web log. Looking at the name of the file on disk though, showed nothing out of the ordinary. It turns out that the unicode representations for the characters in the file name are printed in the terminal as english ascii characters. The only way you can tell that this is the case is to open the file and do a search for the filename itself and see if it matches. For example, if the correct filename is called "challenge1.shtml" you can search for that exact string but NOT find the unicode version of it. Once you find the incorrect file name, delete it and type the correct file name (in this case "challenge3.shtml" into the file and the page works. The final question was a segfault occurring in apache. It resulted in no information being returned to the client. You could see this occurring in the apache web logs as well as the Chrome tools. The apache web logs noted that a core file was dumped. This challenge required that you know a little bit about gdb and C programming. Basically, you need to run the core dump through gdb. gdb /path/to/apache /path/to/core/dump It will spew out a lot of stuff. In particular, it mentions that there is something happening in an apache module; mod_rewrite or something...it doesnt really matter. The output also points to the C source file for that module which is, conveniently on disk. Open that file in vi and jump to the line number mentioned in the gdb output (line 1861 or something). There you will see that if the filename matches challenge4.shtml to SIGSEGV; there\'s your smoke gun. They dont ask you to fix the final challenge, only to explain what the strstr is doing. The error in question basically looks like this if (strstr($r-&gt;filename, "challenge4.shtml") != NULL) { SIGSEGV } Just point out to them that, yeah, it\'s segfaulting when I ask for that file. \xa0', u'There was a paper presented to you with a number of nagios alerts and you had to rate them in the order you would approach fixing them. For example, one of them was a production host being 100% offline. Another was an environment alert about an entire cab that was overheating. Another was the tablet vip being down, another was a load average for the main website being really high. There were also a number of them that were QPS (queries per sec) related and included several security related alerts like XSS QPS and failed logins QPS \xa0']

[u' Questions were simple (same as described in glassdoor). Interviewer called on time, but didn\'t introduce himself. Directly jumped into questions (lags professionalism). There was no NDA. So, I think I can share the questions, 1) Search for "WordDistanceFinder linkedin". http://www.careercup.com/question?id=5725709041401856 2) Search for "TwoSum with test()/store()" methods. https://github.com/fcarriedo/algorithms/blob/master/exercises/twosumtest/TwoSumTest.java I discussed and coded more than two solutions for both problems. Wrote bug free code (verified my code after the interview in other websites). My mistakes: 1) I explained that we can use Set instead of HashMap verbally. I didn\'t type it in the editor. Looks like the lazy interviewer didn\'t make a note on that. Seems hiring committee raised concern on data structures (actually I used HashMap to support future enhancement - again didn\'t type that in the editor). 2) I didn\'t add comments in the code - Its an interview, don\'t expect someone to type comments - thats why I was explaining. 3) Used short variable names (asked interviewer is short notation fine with him... i.e., Used "idx" instead of "index". He was fine with that). Again I didn\'t mention that in the editor. Based on above three mistakes, the hiring committee said they\'ll consider me for Sr. software engineer. but definitely not for Staff Engineer. That too after another PS. Now I\'m wondering whether I\'ve to proceed my candidature with LinkedIn (I\'ve an offer for a director level position with another $3B company). I\'ve taken more than 100 interviews for my company. But this experience disappoints me. Advice to LinkedIn: Please give trainings to your interviewers. Make sure you collect right data points about your candidates (either ask your interviewer type a detailed feedback, or you talk to the interviewer). Because what you see is not the complete picture of the truth. My advice: Whatever you want to convey in a phone screen, make sure you type them in the editor. \xa0']

[u'There were two and they both happened during the live-debugging portion of the interview. All of the live debugging questions revolved around a simple website that had something broken in it. You were to fix the brokenness to be able to move on to the next page. In total there were 4 questions, each getting progressively more difficult to debug. The first question was a simple permissions problem on a file being requested by the client. The ownership of the file (a blank text file) was too restrictive, so it was raising an error. You could verify this in the apache web logs. The second error was due to a permission problem too, however this time the file was hidden in a sub directory of the main web site. You could only determine this by looking at the apache configuration file to see that the shtml file was located somewhere else. After that, change the permissions to fix. The third was a head scratcher. The filename in question was raising a 500 error and showing urlencoded characters in the filename in the web log. Looking at the name of the file on disk though, showed nothing out of the ordinary. It turns out that the unicode representations for the characters in the file name are printed in the terminal as english ascii characters. The only way you can tell that this is the case is to open the file and do a search for the filename itself and see if it matches. For example, if the correct filename is called "challenge1.shtml" you can search for that exact string but NOT find the unicode version of it. Once you find the incorrect file name, delete it and type the correct file name (in this case "challenge3.shtml" into the file and the page works. The final question was a segfault occurring in apache. It resulted in no information being returned to the client. You could see this occurring in the apache web logs as well as the Chrome tools. The apache web logs noted that a core file was dumped. This challenge required that you know a little bit about gdb and C programming. Basically, you need to run the core dump through gdb. gdb /path/to/apache /path/to/core/dump It will spew out a lot of stuff. In particular, it mentions that there is something happening in an apache module; mod_rewrite or something...it doesnt really matter. The output also points to the C source file for that module which is, conveniently on disk. Open that file in vi and jump to the line number mentioned in the gdb output (line 1861 or something). There you will see that if the filename matches challenge4.shtml to SIGSEGV; there\'s your smoke gun. They dont ask you to fix the final challenge, only to explain what the strstr is doing. The error in question basically looks like this if (strstr($r-&gt;filename, "challenge4.shtml") != NULL) { SIGSEGV } Just point out to them that, yeah, it\'s segfaulting when I ask for that file. \xa0', u'There was a paper presented to you with a number of nagios alerts and you had to rate them in the order you would approach fixing them. For example, one of them was a production host being 100% offline. Another was an environment alert about an entire cab that was overheating.

There were also a number of them that were QPS (queries per sec) related and included several security related alerts like XSS QPS and failed logins QPS \xa0']
