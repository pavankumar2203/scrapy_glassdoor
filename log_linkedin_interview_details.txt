[u' Questions were simple (same as described in glassdoor). Interviewer called on time, but didn\'t introduce himself. Directly jumped into questions (lags professionalism). There was no NDA. So, I think I can share the questions, 1) Search for "WordDistanceFinder linkedin". http://www.careercup.com/question?id=5725709041401856 2) Search for "TwoSum with test()/store()" methods. https://github.com/fcarriedo/algorithms/blob/master/exercises/twosumtest/TwoSumTest.java I discussed and coded more than two solutions for both problems. Wrote bug free code (verified my code after the interview in other websites). My mistakes: 1) I explained that we can use Set instead of HashMap verbally. I didn\'t type it in the editor. Looks like the lazy interviewer didn\'t make a note on that. Seems hiring committee raised concern on data structures (actually I used HashMap to support future enhancement - again didn\'t type that in the editor). 2) I didn\'t add comments in the code - Its an interview, don\'t expect someone to type comments - thats why I was explaining. 3) Used short variable names (asked interviewer is short notation fine with him... i.e., Used "idx" instead of "index". He was fine with that). Again I didn\'t mention that in the editor. Based on above three mistakes, the hiring committee said they\'ll consider me for Sr. software engineer. but definitely not for Staff Engineer. That too after another PS. Now I\'m wondering whether I\'ve to proceed my candidature with LinkedIn (I\'ve an offer for a director level position with another $3B company). I\'ve taken more than 100 interviews for my company. But this experience disappoints me. Advice to LinkedIn: Please give trainings to your interviewers. Make sure you collect right data points about your candidates (either ask your interviewer type a detailed feedback, or you talk to the interviewer). Because what you see is not the complete picture of the truth. My advice: Whatever you want to convey in a phone screen, make sure you type them in the editor. \xa0']

[u'There were two and they both happened during the live-debugging portion of the interview. All of the live debugging questions revolved around a simple website that had something broken in it. You were to fix the brokenness to be able to move on to the next page. In total there were 4 questions, each getting progressively more difficult to debug. The first question was a simple permissions problem on a file being requested by the client. The ownership of the file (a blank text file) was too restrictive, so it was raising an error. You could verify this in the apache web logs. The second error was due to a permission problem too, however this time the file was hidden in a sub directory of the main web site. You could only determine this by looking at the apache configuration file to see that the shtml file was located somewhere else. After that, change the permissions to fix. The third was a head scratcher. The filename in question was raising a 500 error and showing urlencoded characters in the filename in the web log. Looking at the name of the file on disk though, showed nothing out of the ordinary. It turns out that the unicode representations for the characters in the file name are printed in the terminal as english ascii characters. The only way you can tell that this is the case is to open the file and do a search for the filename itself and see if it matches. For example, if the correct filename is called "challenge1.shtml" you can search for that exact string but NOT find the unicode version of it. Once you find the incorrect file name, delete it and type the correct file name (in this case "challenge3.shtml" into the file and the page works. The final question was a segfault occurring in apache. It resulted in no information being returned to the client. You could see this occurring in the apache web logs as well as the Chrome tools. The apache web logs noted that a core file was dumped. This challenge required that you know a little bit about gdb and C programming. Basically, you need to run the core dump through gdb. gdb /path/to/apache /path/to/core/dump It will spew out a lot of stuff. In particular, it mentions that there is something happening in an apache module; mod_rewrite or something...it doesnt really matter. The output also points to the C source file for that module which is, conveniently on disk. Open that file in vi and jump to the line number mentioned in the gdb output (line 1861 or something). There you will see that if the filename matches challenge4.shtml to SIGSEGV; there\'s your smoke gun. They dont ask you to fix the final challenge, only to explain what the strstr is doing. The error in question basically looks like this if (strstr($r-&gt;filename, "challenge4.shtml") != NULL) { SIGSEGV } Just point out to them that, yeah, it\'s segfaulting when I ask for that file. \xa0', u'There was a paper presented to you with a number of nagios alerts and you had to rate them in the order you would approach fixing them. For example, one of them was a production host being 100% offline. Another was an environment alert about an entire cab that was overheating. Another was the tablet vip being down, another was a load average for the main website being really high. There were also a number of them that were QPS (queries per sec) related and included several security related alerts like XSS QPS and failed logins QPS \xa0']
