[u'I did not apply on the website. In June 2015, a recruiter reached out via LinkedIn requesting if I would like to speak over the phone with her if I were interested in knowing more about the position. She reached out on a Monday and I had an interview that Friday of the same week. On the phone, she requested if I would like to meet with one of the members of the team for a phone interview. The next Tuesday, I had a phone interview with one of the team members (who would be my peer). The interview lasted about 45 minutes. About two days later, the recruiter reached out to me stating they went with a candidate with more experience.']
[u'The interview process included a pre-screening phone call with basic questions and then advanced to a Skype interview two weeks later. It took a while to hear back from my interviewer both times, I had to reach out a few days after each interview.']
[u'The position offered was that of a contractor for 6 months duration. The hourly rate was lower than competitive positions for similar level of experience. Interview process was a mix of questions related to Data Analysis, Product Management, Machine Learning.']
[u"They miss the first schedule interview, and they didn't even call me later. I had to call back a day later. They rescheduled and even that time the interview started 20 minutes late. They seemed to be in a hurry and not really interested in the interview. Overall not a very good experience."]
[u"Contacted by recruiter, agreed to do phone screen, went on site. Had 5 interviews. Two coding/algorithmis, one design, one communication, one chatting about my history. Also had lunch in the cafeteria. They have an ipad with your schedule for the day. They let you know your interviewers ahead of time. The recruiting host shows you around the place before you start. It's a nice place."]
[u'first had a call with an HR lady (very professional - not all LNK recuiters are), next a chat with the hiring manager, a conference call with 3 sales directors (one was a professional, the other not really and finally an on-site meeting with my direct manager. pretty easy all in all.']
[u'Very good communication and logistics. It was an open and very inviting PROCESS. The actual interviews were not very structured. They seemed to not really know what they were looking for and asked a lot of generic questions. I can\'t really pin point what they were looking for and they gave me very generic feedback about my qualifications for the position. I was very excited about working for the company BEFORE the interview. After the interview - not so much. If you are looking for a first job or a "cool company" to put on your resume I am sure it is fine. If you are a seasoned professional there are a lot of places you can make an impact without working here.']
[u"The internal recruiter who identified and contacted me was excellent in all respects: very professional, helpful, diligent, and genuinely trying to identify the best talent for the company. I was given enough information about what to expect from the interview process, how to prepare for it, about the team and its goals as well as the company's recent highlights. And then came the phone screen... The interviewer was very satisfied with my coding skills and told me during the call itself that I finished it faster than other candidates. He then asked me a few questions related to data science and algorithms. For just one of them, I told him that I looked into the mathematics of it about three years back, and so do not have the mathematical details of it on the top of my head, and then gave him an overview of the concepts involved. That was it. I was rejected, for saying that one partially negative thing about myself. In the recent times, many companies are trying hard to improve their interview processes, as was evident in how the internal recruiter handled it. The interviewers are in need of more training still."]
[u'There was a technical phone interview, then an online programming test, and then 4 hour long one on one interview and a free lunch. The technical phone interview was mostly a test of my technical vocabulary. The programming test was pretty strait forward, but I am a programmer, so that might have been a help. The four one on one interviews where not that stressful, but then I did not get hired, so maybe I should have been more stressed.']
[u'LinkedIn\'s interview process is very transparent. Before every interview, I was given the names and LinkedIn profiles of every person I would speak to. My recruiter also called me before each interview step to discuss the expectations and share a few preparation tips. Even if you don\'t end up working with them, you\'ll probably at least come away feeling much more knowledgeable and prepared for technical interviews in general! I noticed two unusual aspects about LinkedIn\'s software engineer interviews: (1) Most interviews are 2-on-1, with both interviewers submitting feedback. (2) Their coding questions apparently come from a shared company-wide repository. All the coding questions I got were identical (verbatim) to ones that have already been posted here or on other sites. I didn\'t know this upfront, but I realized it when I looked them up after my interviews. My interview process was: Technical phone screen: - 2 coding questions On-site interview: - 2 coding / algorithms - 1 system design - 1 technical communication - 1 behavioral / cultural fit (host manager) - 1 lunch interview (note: the lunch interviewer does submit feedback too) The coding questions were all very easy. I would say they were of slightly below-average difficulty compared to many other major Silicon Valley tech companies. I got the impression that the LinkedIn folks pay much more attention to your communication skills and design thinking than your raw problem-solving ability. The technical communication interview was fun. Basically I was asked to talk through one of my previous projects / systems, as if I were orienting a new developer on my team. It felt just like a real engineering discussion at work. Likewise, the host manager interview was really relaxed, focusing mostly on probing my resume and past experience, and the typical behavioral type questions ("tell me about a time when..."). The system design interview was probably the most challenging aspect of the process. LinkedIn is a web-scale company after all, so you need to have at least some basic familiarity with building distributed systems and making architectural design trade-offs in that context. Of all the components of the on-site interview, I would recommend spending more time preparing well for this one. I definitely came away with a very positive impression of LinkedIn. All the interviewers I met were very friendly and smart, and all of them talked about how they loved the highly collaborative culture at LinkedIn. Definitely give these folks a shot if you have the opportunity.']
[u'It was a phone interview to discuss what the job entailed and my skills. I had more experience than the position called for, but the recruiter was still open to discussing my capabilities.']
[u'I applied online and got contacted by recruiter the next day. He was very nice and quickly arranged a phone screening. The interviewer called me and asked me two questions - two sum problem, and parenthesis matching. I missed to handle one edge case and the next day got a rejection call. The problem which I see here is that in one of the questions, I was talking about Java String internals, how a String is backed by a character array, and she had no idea of what I was talking about. That might have offended her. I have solved two sum problem and parenthesis matching problem many times before and I do not expect to get a rejection, but I got it. I am a PhD and have 4 years of experience.']
[u'Very well organized and thought out day of events at LinkedIn. Interviews themselves were mixed: some difficult, some easy. The analytical interview was most challenging. Be ready to talk in depth about any ideas you have.']
[u'There were three rounds. The first was with a phone interview with a recruiter. The next was a face to face interview with the manager. The final round was an interview with the recruitment manager as well as a manager in the US, which we did via Video Conference']
[u'Recruiter contacted me and I conveyed mu interest. After a week he called me asked my background and finally agreed for Staff Test Engineer position. Then got the detailed job description and the study material for the interview. Prepared many glassdoor questions and appeared for phone interview but unfortunately got a new question which I never prepared for.']
[u'The interview process here is smooth. They give you a good clarity on whats going to happen next and that really helps you get prepared for the same. The candidate experience is what they focus on and that really works as inspite of the fact you get selected or not you go through a smooth process without any hurdles.']
[u"Interview process started with telephonic interviews with the HR in mountain view. I would receive calls at 11 PM in the night. Being a late sleeper I did not mind this. The HR consulted me for interview time, and made sure I was comfortable with the process. I technical rounds on Skype, which lasted around an hour. The questions were standard, and I was able to clear them easily. After this there was an HR round, which had quite run of the mill questions, like 'why LinkedIn?' and soon the HR was on to the topic of compensation and my role with the company, at which point I knew I was in."]
[u"Efficient, friendly and open 1 recruiter phone interview 1 management phone interview 4 50 minute intervies on-site interviews and Excel test Recruiter was very helpful and responsive. Set my expectations correctly from the start. No salary negotiations as they met my terms straight up. Very swift to process background and reference checks. Only issue was Excel test as I wasn't informed of this. Could have done with a mouse as the touchpad on the laptop was pretty awful. Overall a very pleasant experience and felt I got to know the team quite well."]
[u"Contacted by their recruiter. Next day had a call with her, and within 24 hours they scheduled a phone interview for the next week. Smooth and clear, no hiccups. Phone interview was with one of their junior SWE, he was very nice and polite. We briefly talked about each others' past and current projects and went straight to the coding. Was not that hard after all, I just did not have a practice of that sort of interactive coding. The guy, again, was polite, few times gave me some small hints. At the end he confirmed that I did it correct. Recruiter contacted me next morning and asked for another phone call with more senior team members. Going to do it next week."]
[u'Linkedin is hiring like crazy right now - on the particular random day I arrived, there were at least 10 other applicants hanging around the receptionist\'s desk. They sent me a solicitation on linkedin (no surprise), and I followed up and had a technical phone screen quickly scheduled. They then flew me out to interview on-site about a week later and put me up in a really nice hotel. They gave me a gift bag on arrival, and the whole process felt really comfortable, which is unusual for an interview. I interviewed with something like 11 people total, some alone, and some in groups of 2. Half of those interviews were about demonstrating programming skills on a whiteboard, the other half were for demonstrating "design" skills (abstractly designing systems). There was a break in the middle for lunch in their giant, excellent cafeteria.']
[u"Applied in LinkedIn portal for Staff Engineer. Got a call from recruiter on the next day and she explained the details very nicely. Recruiter response was prompt. Recruiter scheduled the Phone Screen (PS) very next day for the Staff Engineer role. I've 8+ years of experience in software development (working in world's #1 online retailer for 3.5 years)."]
[u'I was referred by a friend. Firstly I had a phone screen, and was asked about a string related question and a question about reading logs. Then I was scheduled an onsite interview, the design question is hard because I never had this kind of question before. the whole process is pretty fast and the overall experience is very good.']
[u'Recently I had a phone interview with LinkedIn. The coding question (using collabedit) is something like "Search a sorted array for the first element larger than k." I had studied Data Structures and Algorithms extensively and know binary search by heart. So this is pretty easy for me. However, to my very surprise, the interviewer told me that my code has an infinite loop! I double checked the code and explained it can\'t have an infinite loop: During each iteration, 1> hi is updated to (mid-1) or 2> lo is updated to (mid+1) But it appeared that the return statement was incorrectly indented and inside the while loop. After the call, I put the code in a file and ran the script. As I expected, there is no endless loop and all tests passed perfectly. Then I asked the interviewer where the infinite loop came from. During the call, I asked for a hint about the infinite loop and he said that would be too easy. Now that the call was over, he did reply with the following: "I identified the issue after the call. The issue was caused by an incorrect indentation which you resolved later during the call." What he said made no sense at all! The indentation issue I mentioned is related to the return statement. If there was an issue with the return statement, the code would terminate prematurely and there is no way to cause an infinite loop. For those who will have an interview with LinkedIn, be prepared for such non-sense.']
[u'Submit application and submit resume online, schedule and complete phone screening with recruiter and hiring manager, schedule and travel for on-site interviews with multiple folks including VP of the function, peers, and direct manager, receive offer letter with terms of employment, return acceptance offer, complete on-site onboarding (which was great), set up benefits online.']
[u"Had one technical phone screen which was easy. Then was called onsite for a set of 5 rounds. It was a long day of interviews. The interviewer in the first algorithm round had a fixed solution in his head and could not accept any other solution and was always trying to force me to move towards how he thinks the problem should be solved rather than what I was doing, he had no interest in my solution and I know my solution was right because I had solved that problem before and had confirmed it with online solutions and new all the ways of doing it. The second algorithms round was a dynamic programming round and to my surprise one of the interviewers had no clue about DP and was constantly arguing with me and the other interviewer saying that my solution was wrong. However the first interviewer understood my solution and agreed with what I was doing and was trying to explain to the other interviewer that my approach was different but most optimal( I was doing a bottom up DP where as he only knew how to do Top down which is recursion with memoization). After 30 mins of explaining to the second interviewer, he still couldnt get what is bottom up DP. I was very disappointed with Linked in on this. They should send interviewers who know their stuff or atleast what they are asking..lol. The design round was not a typical design round, instead of having a discussion with what's right and wrong with my design, he just asked me a series of questions and got done with the interview, I felt as if he was just assessing my answers based on what he had in mind. The manager round was good and relaxed. The last round i.e technical communication doesnt make any sense as everything is already covered in the manager round. I guess I just had a bad day on my luck with weird interviewers"]
[u'The interview process was professional and lengthy, occurring over a two month period. First interview was with the hiring manager who balanced the interview between questions about me and sharing an overview of the job requirements. Subsequent interviews involved senior colleagues, country managers and finally the hiring managers manager. Most were telecalls due to location and time zones. Overall the process was thorough and quite enjoyable, while it did not conclude with an offer and acceptance I believe it would be a great company to work for.']
[u'Brief call by recruiter followed by phone screen with two interviewers. This session was mostly a coding round with questions around data-structures. There were two pieces to it and I eventually solved both. I did not qualify perhaps because of a false-start to the solution of the second problem though I quickly corrected myself.']
[u'Contacted by recruiter and was scheduled for the first Phone Interview . Gave me enough time to prepare for the interview. Scheduled my phone screen after a month. I had two interviewers interviewing me. Each person asked one algorithmic question each.']
[u'Was referred and had an in person interview. It was a positive experience with the recruiter. Had pretty good vibes, comfortable setting, and enjoyed the process as I was screened. My interviewer maintained a very positive and upbeat attitude that made the screening process a positively unforgettable one. What was more impressive was how the continue maintaining professional relationship after my interview.']
[u'Great interview process - well orchestrated. Recruiter followed by two screens and one day of final interview. Recruiter was engaged throughout the process and kept me updated. Folks were friendly looking for specific past experience in the role to determine fit.']
[u"I had a friendly and proactive phone interview with the recruiter. She inquired about my background, asked me to explain a few things from my resume and gave me tons of information on what they are looking for. The recruiter was so nice, professional, and treated me with the utmost respect. After talking with her, I spent tons of hours understanding what LinkedIn was looking for in a candidate, researching their history and preparing for basic interview questions. The NEXT interview was with the hiring manager and it was the worst experience I have ever had. She was rude, condescending and kept the conversation short (it literally didn't last 10 minutes). I got off the phone in tears. I'm not one to cry over not getting a job, but it was the most horrible experience that left me shocked."]
[u"Recruiter phone call, one technical phone screen, and if you're good enough there, two more technical phone screens. This is for people located far from LinkedIn (so those in the Bay Area will experience an on-site interview)."]
[u"I applied through an employee referral to the job at its headquarter in Beijing, China, and it took 6 rounds of interview before they decided to hire me. First there was the phone interview, the recruiter asked about my plans and general questions; then I was invited for an on-site interview. Started with the same recruiter, asked about the company's mission/vision/current status and stuff, then a senior recruiter came in asked for specific questions regarding my past experiences, next was someone at the position I was applying to and asked for 2 rounds of role play, one for B2C cold call and another was B2B cold call. Then the vice president of sales came in, went through my CV in great details for like 45 mins, before the senior recruiter came back in for another round of general information inquiry. The last round was with the vice president of operation, and he would approve for the hiring. I declined the offer, however, they asked whether I would start working immediately or to pursue with my education in Stanford University. I chose the latter."]
[u"I had an initial phone screen with a consultant that went well despite the fact that the consultant called 15 minutes late. Next I had another phone interview with someone from the recruiting team. Again, a positive experience. Finally I had a third phone interview with the hiring manager. That interview lasted only 20 minutes because the hiring manager also called late, and was in a rush. I was invited to come to headquarters to interview by the recruiter but at some point in the process of working around hiring manager's schedule, that never got confirmed. Unfortunately, the lack of time and attention given by the hiring manager turned me off somewhat in the process, and I probably wasn't that interested. Also interesting note that the final word about the outcome came in an email from the recruiter at 1:00 in the morning. I guess they work some crazy hours at LinkedIn."]
[u'Very streamlined and pleasant interview process. Started off with a recruiter contact me to describe the position and gather my background. A phone interview was scheduled. The interviewer called and introduced himself and asked about my background. He then asked several high level iOS development question. Afterwards we used Colabedit to work on 2 algorithm problems. The problems were fairly straightforward and general preparation is sufficient. The interviewer did a great job talking through the problems with me and gently prodding along though sticking points. About a week later I received an email stating I was invited to interview on site in San Fransisco. Driving at the office I was greeted and taken to my interview room. I was presented with a small gift bag of snacks and a welcome note on the white board which was a nice touch. There were 6 interviews. Since this was for an iOS position it was nice to see that 2 of the interviews were actually iOS engineers who specifically focused on the platform. One was an algorithm interview consisting of 2 problems. Another was for system design, which involved designing an app and the corresponding api. There was a casual lunch interview, and finally a chat with the hiring manager. Every person I spoke with was nice, helpful and generally pleasant. The experience was as pleasant as an interview gets.']
[u"It was referral from employee. Initial communication was good but the subsequent communications were slow. I had to remind the recruiter several times. Interview went well and I was very confident. The HR finally told I was great but they had another better candidate and hence couldn't make an offer."]
[u'I contacted the recruiter regarding the position and she arranged a phone interview with 2 members of the team within a week. She told me that there would be the interview would be for 45 min and there would be 2 coding questions. So the interviewers would be evaluating speed,accuracy and also the efficiency of the code']
[u'Several rounds of interviews 1st Round Recruiter and wait 2-3 weeks for them to shortlist the rest of the interviewed candidates. 2nd Round Hiring Manager and if positive, will schedule to speak with peers. 3rd Round with peers for a relatively casual chat. 4th Presentation to Hiring Team.']
[u'It was hard but informational. I learned about the culture, company, and role I would be doing. It was long as well. SO many interviews. I wish it was shorter as it took away from my overall experience and somewhat left a bad taste in my mouth.']
[u'HR screening is pleasant. On-site interview was 2 back-to-back interviews with hiring manager and another interviewer. These interviews were very unstructured but interviewers were friendly, which shows the LinkedIn culture.']
[u"Had three interviews, first one was a competency based interview with the manager of the sales development team, second one was with HR, and third one was a presentation and role play with two team managers. I went through a referral system and had 3 interviews, so I'd imagine there would be 4 - 5 interviews for candidates who didn't have a referral."]
[u'There are usually 1-2 rounds of phone interview. After you pass them, then, you will have to go to an on-site interview which usually last one day. There are 5 modules in total for the onsite interview questions. If everything goes well, then you will be matched with a team to see if you like it, and negotiate the salary.']
[u'3 rounds of back to back phone interview and each round there are 2 engineers on the employer side. The interview questions are not difficult. But sometimes the questions themselves are tricky and you have to make sure you really understand the problem to solve.']
[u"Had a positive experience with the initial phone screen with the recruiter, but things got a little rough at the technical part of the interview because I couldn't understand my interviewer's accent. I was interviewed by 2 people, both very new to the company, and one of them barely spoke at all. The one who did tried to help when I forgot one of the edge cases for the harder programming problem - it seems like they want you to do well. Questions weren't too hard, but you definitely need to prepare."]
[u'Contacted by a recruiter through LinkedIn itself, scheduled a small talk about my experience and interests, recruiter was very nice and helpful. Then scheduled an interview call with two more technical interviewers from different teams using an online review-coding portal, first they introduce themselves, then you need to talk a bit about what you do and your past experience and then move to the coding problems, mostly related to algorithms. After that call the process is to interview on-site where you could have from 3 to 5 interviews.']
[u'The process took 3 weeks. The recruiter was helpful. Questions were simple and basic. There was a coding round and an interview with a hiring manager. The coding round was simple and the interviewer was helpful. Interview about the hiring manager were mostly about problem solving ad coming up with metrics']
[u'Both the interviewer and recruiter were extremely professional and friendly at the same time. The interview lasted 45 minutes and the interviewer was clear in communicating the expectations of the role and providing information on the upcoming rounds of interviews. Mostly behaviorial questions and questions revolving sharing of my personal experience were posted.']
[u"1. Call from the recruiter. Mainly just about my past jobs. (20 min) 2. Technical call by a senior web developer. Technical questions about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. (30 min) Mainly I was asked about positioning html with css, accesibility and frameworks that I use. 3. Technical call with collabedit by two Sr. Web developers . Technical questions about HTML and CSS. (45 min) They showed me an image and asked me to type the structure for the HTML, and then apply the CSS rules. 4. Technical call with collabedit by a Sr. Web developer and a Web developer (45 min) They showed me some code and asked me to describe what was happening there and why. Knowing how value vs reference type and how context works is needed to answer this correctly. I was asked to code the isPalindrome() function and another problem that uses your previously coded isPalindrome function that the interviewer had difficulties trying to explain to me. At the end, I got the idea and explained what I would do because the time was almost over. 5. In site interview in Mountan View, CA (I didn't make it to this interview) The third and fourth interviews where done the same day consecutively. I didn't make it to the 5th interview because my HTML and CSS were not good enough. Basically, I feel the reason why they didn't like it is because I didn't use the elements correctly. Semantic elements are very important to them. Learning experience for me and loss for them. I still think that I would have been perfect for the job. My JavaScript interview went great. The recruiter called me to tell me the bad news. He explicitly said I didn't make it because of the third interview. I appreciate the fact that he called me instead of sending me an email. Overall, it was a great interview process."]
[u'After speaking with the recruiter I had a brief homework assignment with some data analysis and role-specific questions. I then spoke with the hiring manager briefly again before going on site. Everyone was very friendly and the recruiters were terrific. The questions were mostly behavioral and about my experience.']
[u"The recruiter was great and very professional. My first interview was good but the hiring manager had problems with their bluejeans video chat. I made it on to the second round with a director and it didn't go well. She also had problems with their video software. She was about 10 min late and we had a 20 minute chat. She was more interested in my military background and why I left. Which did I prefer military or corporate? She seemed more interested in what I send my international team for care packages than my current experience which was very similar to what they were looking for. Honestly, i had a bad experience and felt that she didn't care for my veteran experience and the fact that I'm a also a minority, which is a very common trend with silicon valley corporations. Being a veteran is an asset, i traveled to over 25 countries, lead multiple teams, projects and I gained a ton of experience in developing reports. I left the military 8 years ago and I have done many great things since I left all with the same company. I don't know what she was looking for but I have an advance degree, I speak two languages, I have over 15 years of experience in leading people, I work for another tech company and I'm used to the pace and challenges of fast moving environment. I really good with data mining and sourcing. I got no real feedback from the recruiter so, I'm only left to wonder why I did wrong."]
[u"They brought me in to the Mountain View campus for an in-person. The interview process took all day and involved meeting with 5 different teams. Each interview was on a different topic and included hands on iOS programming in Xcode, Objective C questions, questions on networking and also general behavioral questions. I also got treated to lunch at their awesome cafeteria. The interview questions were quite tough so if you're going in, make sure you know Objective C language details in and out, know your way around Xcode, and have knowledge or experience in networking."]
[u'Process was managed by the recruiter ( this was in 2014). She was incredibly professional and her team was very responsive. After a couple phone screens, I was invited to campus, set up in a room and was then interviewed by a series of functional leaders. The process lasted about 5 hrs ( one was a lunch meeting). Most of the questions were deep dives into my experience with some scenario questions.']
[u'I was contacted directly by LinkedIn, through LinkedIn for the interview. A phone screen was setup where I spoke with two people who barely spoke English. The only non-technical question they ever posed to me was "What your background?" after I said hello, and not a single follow-up question beyond my concise response. After listening to each of them provide a 30 second background of their own, both of which were completely non-comprehensible, they moved immediately to collabedit. With minor prompting, I was able to solve both questions they posed with optimal answers. I was very confident that amidst their lack of ability to effectively communicate, I had still performed extremely well. I followed up after the interview with a thank you email to the recruiter. After two weeks of hearing nothing, I sent another follow-up to the recruiter. Days after this I received a non-professional email from a new recruiter stating that my previous recruiter was no longer with the company, and that I did not perform to their expectations. In his words exactly, "I regret to inform you that your interview didn\u2019t go as well as we had hoped it would. Do understand that these interviews are quite challenging...". I\'m quite self critical, and had I fumbled on the technical questions even a little bit, I would shrug this off, but I did not. I asked the new recruiter if they could provide me with even a rough notion of the feedback so that I could grow as a developer, understand where I fell short, and work on those areas such that I could improve. Well, needless to say, I never got another response from him, and to this day have been completely ignored. I\'m only thankful for this experience so that I know to avoid this company in the future. I\'ll take a hint from the only professional I interacted with (the first recruiter), waste no more time with this with this company, and like him, high tail it out of there and never look back.']
[u'3 Rounds - 2 phone screens for an hour - 1 onsite - 2 Coding - 1 System Design - 1 Experience - 1 Hiring Manager']
[u"I interviewed with the Recruiter and they were thrilled with my experience and said I was the perfect fit. They said they would to set me up immediately with the next interview, within 1-2 days. I kept my calendar open. 5 days went by and I didn't hear anything so I emailed the Recruiter. At day 11, the Recruiter finally emailed me to let me know the position was filled. Mixed messages and no contact = poor candidate experience."]
[u'6 - 7 round interview using Skype / video conferencing. 1 round presentation with a panel from India & US. Good thing was none of the questions at any stage were repetitive. All were right on time. competency based assessment.']
[u"Recruiter contacted me. Set up a phone interview. I was informed there will be two interviewers on the phone, but only one of them turned up, not sure if other guy was on mute since he was new to LinkedIn per his linkedIn profile. The interviewer's body language revealed a lot about him. He was trying to be nice, but that wasn't really true. Asked me about skill set and then moved to technical part. First 35-40 minutes was about c++ questions and multi-threading. Then last 20 minutes or so was coding question. Overall the interview lasted for 1 hour. I took about 5-10 minutes to understand the question, primarily because there was about 30 lines of code pasted in collabedit already. When I tried to ask a question to clarify, I was told there is nothing to ask, everything is on collabedit. I guess I will let you guess his attitude. I explained him my pseudocode before coding and he seemed to be happy with it. I almost was done with the solution by end of 1 hour, but I guess that does not count. He did not give me a chance to ask my questions. To summarize, a lot of reviews on glassdoor says they repeat the questions. That was not the case with me, so please be prepared completely. Just don't depend completely on glassdoor. Go to leetcode, hackerrank, geeksforgeeks and careercup. As for books, cracking the coding interviews is awesome! Its not even one day yet, so I haven't heard back from recruiter, but I am not expecting a good result."]
[u'The process was very professional. Feedback was given exactly when they said it would and the whole process ran very smoothly. It took about 2 months and involved two phone interview, a panel interview (including a presentation), and a final 1 on 1 interview with a senior manager.']
[u"I have been contacted by a Recruiting Associate, who was very friendly, and asked me if I was interested in the role. I agreed to go through an initial phone interview with a Recruiter. The interview went quite well, but I didn't make it to the next stage, as I was told that they were looking for someone with more experience."]
[u'Long and drawn out, took several weeks to schedule each interview. HR not very helpful and takes very long to respond. Made it to final rounds and then no word from HR. Followed up and found out the company had a major re-org and the position was eliminated. Would have been nice to know this earlier rather than the drawn out waiting process.']
[u'INterview process was intense- 3 phone interviews, 1 6 pannel interview in person, and then finally you present a 30, 60, 90 day plan on how you would ramp up to speed. very results and data driven.']
[u"Many phone screens, and then a whole day onsite 9am - 4pm meeting with 5-6 people. Seemed a little unorganized as I meet with people who might have been fill ins for people who couldn't make it. Also had to do additional video call the next day due to scheduling conflict for one person."]
[u'It took a while to get the interview. However, once the interview was setup it was pretty fast. I had one phone screen and was not asked for second phone screen. Phone screen questions are very challenging but all are from glass-door. My advice to you is just solve the career-cup or glass-door problem and you are going to be fine. Binary tree, array, number format.']
[u"Applied through Linkedin. Got technical phone interview - 2 questions, one on recursion and the other standard programming question. 6 interviews at onsite(1 algo,1 programming,1 design,1 manager,1 lunch/cultual fit,1 tech discussion). Interviewers were nice. If you've to run behind your recruiter to get a result, it means you haven't got the offer."]
[u"The interview process was very friendly. It wasn't one of those interviews where the interviewers get super high pressure on you and push you to feel uncomfortable. It mostly seemed to be about culture fit and making sure I had a minimum threshold of logical reasoning necessary for the job. If you go in with a positive attitude, your head on your shoulders, and conviction, then the interview should go totally fine and without hitch."]
[u'This was a phone interview, briefly asked about work experience and why you have interest in the job. Told a little about the position and how it would work. After that, was told they would follow up for in person interview if they wanted to move forward.']
[u'2 Stage Interview Ended with a Presentation It started with a hour long phone call then called into a group interview at their offices. It last 2 hours asking several questions such as what I knew of the company and why I wanted to work there. Several standard HR Questions.']
[u"1- HR Phone Screening 2- Hiring Mgr Phone Screening 3- Behavioral Onsite Interview 4- Technical Onsite Interview 5- HR/Hiring Manager debrief The interview experience at LinkedIn was unforgettable! As a candidate, they gave me a red-carpet experience. Each individual who interacted/interviewed me, made me feel special, showed utter care, and were very responsive of all my queries during the process! The way recruiters (spoke to around 4) presented LinkedIn made my choice absolutely strong towards LinkedIn! At each interaction they lived up LinkedIn's core values. The recruiters made each step in the interview process very transparent, provided information that helped me prepare well for each phase which eventually utilized my limited time with each interviewer well. Each interviewer was well versed on the role I was being interviewed for. They were warm and welcoming. Their questions were very specific and to the point that open up discussion topics to help align our expectations (as candidate and employer). These were the steps that set LinkedIn apart from other companies and their interview processes (I was at that time interviewing with Gap, ThoughtWorks, First Republic Bank, Practice Fusion). It made me, as a candidate, believe the company lives up to its own culture and value. It made me feel comfortable to move forward with my decision to join LinkedIn because if the way you treated me, as a candidate, with such attention and care, as an employee, it will be the same if not more. From the welcome note, to Thank you card, interviewers LI profile handy in iPad, to the goodie bag that was handed during the interview, to the follow up calls, and last but not the least to the welcome gift basket, the entire interview panel if put in simple words: LinkedIn has nailed the recruiting process! The whole experience is what makes LinkedIn THE LEADER when it comes to recruiting and that was my take as a candidate!"]
[u"I did a technical phone screen (yes, as all have said, the questions are all from here - just prepare Software Engineer, Senior Engineer and Principal Engineer questions and you will be completely covered). Every coding round has two questions - one easy and one difficult. You will need to answer both of them to move forward. The phone screen was done (Solved both the questions in less than 30 mins) and I was invited onsite. The onsite begins with a tour of the office which is nice. The recruiting coordinator was friendly and nice. They gave me a loaner iPad with my schedule for the day. They also gave me a goody bag with a couple snacks and my LinkedIn connection map which was a nice personal touch. I then met with the recruiter for about 15 minutes - general casual talk about my job search. The first round is a host manager round. They question you on each of your prior experiences and ask you why you left that job, what kind of work you did there, how big a team, what was your contribution and so on. The second round is a coding round - two engineers and two questions (all questions are documented in Glassdoor multiple times from others so wont repeat it here). Third is technical communication and you have to explain your project in depth to an engineer - the engineer asks some questions on your decisions so please be ready to explain them. The next was the lunch interview - non technical and casual talk but the interviewer provides feedback on you. Next is a system design round (Again question is already on Glassdoor and is repeated many times - prepare variations of sliding time window system design for big data systems, and you will be able to answer questions here). Next was the final coding round - again two questions. Again just repetitive questions - nothing fancy. One of the final interviewers (he was a Senior SDE) did not know the answer to the question he posed. My code is an exact implementation from CLRS' algorithm book that I had prepared by reading up the question on Glassdoor. He did not get it/even look interested in getting it. His head was buried into his laptop and he could not be bothered into listening to me. He had a co-interviewer who wanted to talk/participate but this guy kept cutting him off - so unprofessional. Until this round, I had no negative impressions on LinkedIn and thought it might be a great place to work but this one guy started making me have my doubts on the quality of engineers there (again, there are bad employees everywhere - even in my current workplace - so it is probably just my frustration). On the offer, I did not get one. Overall, I had four good rounds and one bad round. Two things for LinkedIn to note: a. Please provide answers to the interview questions to your interviewers in addition to the questions from the question bank, so they know the answers to at least the questions they are asking and not waste people's time. b. When I am asked to provide interview feedback on the loaner iPad at the end of the interview, please ask interviewers to step outside. A shout out to the recruiter/sourcer and coordinator - Extremely professional and organized. The recruiter also gave me feedback on my interview performance on their own accord that the only negative feedback was the last coding round. The rest supposedly went well and it was a narrow miss. So one bad round could impact you a big deal.."]
[u'Interviewer wanted me to solve a pretty messy problem processing a spreadsheet input with an online algorithm in python to print a set of tables using maps it in linear time, the problem was not difficult but it sure made me not want to ever work for this company if the interviewer thinks this is a measure of an engineer, then they should get a PhD and write the code for a billion dollar startup like I have done.']
[u'I Applied through a recruiter. Recruiter was polite and helpful. Recruiter explained the process and sent some preparation material for reference. After 2.5 weeks one phone round was arranged. Interviewer started by asking a brief introduction, present and past job experience, challenges faced in work etc. Then he asked to solve a coding problem pasted on collabedit. I used python to solve it. Question was not difficult, though I made a small mistake in code. Then he asked If I have any questions for him. Total time of phone call was around 50 minutes.']
[u'Was contacted on InMail by a recruiter. He was very interested in my skills and we setup a phone interview on the same day. I moved on to the first of two phone screen interviews, the first being a very easy programming challenge, and the second looking at knowledge in many subjects. I passed both of these easily and was brought on site. The hotel I was put up in was very run down, and cheap. Not a deal breaker; but part of why I\'m very dissatisfied with this process. The on site consisted of about 6 different interviews / challenges. The first challenge was a live debugging challenge. They give you a RHEL VM and give you several prompts that involve fixing the webserver. These were ridiculous. One of the issues was in a compiled binary that apache includes, and I needed to hunt down what line in the binary this was happening. I was told (after failing this part), that I was supposed to hot fix it in assembly. I told my interview; if I encountered this in prod, I would likely update the package and move on. The second challenge was a whiteboard system architecture challenge. They tell you to draw and explain a system architecture starting out from a single server to several data centers. This was pretty easy. There was then lunch with one of the managers and immediately after that; I had a behavioral interview with a different manager. There was then a "grill you on everything" interview. It was absurd how detailed they asked me to be. One of the questions was, write pseudo-code you would use to re-create the "ls" command, almost certainly not something I would do as an SRE. The last challenge was also a "grill you on everything" interview. He gave me a table of Nagios alerts and 60 seconds to prioritize which alerts I\'d respond to first. I failed this hard because I spent the first 20 seconds reading the prompt, and I was expected to be able to decipher their cryptic hostnames. The interviewer was very condescending and asked me point blank if I\'ve ever even used Linux before. I was then given a scenario where there was some database issue and I was responding to, and how would I go about communicating this to my superiors. At the end of the last challenge, I had to get on a flight immediately. I had no time to ask questions or talk to anyone else. My overall impression of this interview was that they were looking for an operations person who was a competent programmer, with 5 years experience but would accept a entry-level salary. They said repeatedly that they weren\'t looking for operations people; but someone in the middle of developer and ops; after the interview, I find that hard to believe. Several of my interviewers were rude and condescending, especially considering I was still a senior in college and only had a total of 9 months of hands on job experience. I got a call a few weeks later informing me that I was "too junior" for a position such as this. I think what they\'re looking for is extremely hard to find, and they did a poor job of communicating their expectations for the role.']
[u'There was a phone interview and full day onsite interview. The onsite interview includes more practical IT questions like writing a simple app on provided laptop, design a high-load system, simple CS question. Most questions are very alike already posted here.']
[u"I applied through the job post on linkedin and got a call within 1 week. There was an initial phone screen with a recruiter to go over my background and fit. I then had a 1- hour phone interview with someone from the team. This interview was a mix of case study and an excel test. The case study was mainly related to linkedin's growth strategy. The excel test wasn't difficult but the time is not sufficient - 10 min on the spot to complete advanced analytics."]
[u'Pretty typical interview process. One phone screen with 2 coding problems. Onsite with 5 interviews typically 2 people with one just shadowing another. Be prepared to answer questions from both though.']
[u"I applied on LinkedIn and HR called me in a day or two. HR scheduled first phone screening round and briefed me about the Interview. Phone screen interview Interviewer asked 2 problem solving questions, one after another. One was with moderate complexity and other was bit difficult. Questions Repeated DNA Sequences Find if there is a influencer in matrix of user following relationship matrix I solved both questions. HR informed me about positive feedback of interview and scheduled face to face interviews at LinkedIn office in following week. Since I was working in diffident city, they arranged all travel and accommodations for me. All arrangements were very comfortable. HR had already informed me about all the Interview rounds and schedule of Face to Face Interview. 1st round Questions on designing ETL pipeline Question on MR joins 2nd round Design question - design auto complete article search functionality for slideshre.net 3rd Problem solving question Tree level order traversal - print levels Find top K close point from given point on 2d plane 4th round Sort 1 gb file containing numbers using MapReduce. Surprisingly Interviewer asked me to write MapReduce code on white boards with exact class names & methods. After few discussion over my projects Interviewer again asked me to write some project code on white board which was really very frustrating. 5th round - Hiring manager Manager provided information about various teams and project. He asked few soft skills related questions such what was your most challenging task, how do you help your peers etc. He was trying his best to convince me that I fit well in different team which I was not willing to join. This went on for 2 hours. Next day I received email from HR saying that they will back with next hiring steps. I was anyway not willing to join because of the offered profile was of not my interest but surprisingly HR called and informed that they don't want to process further as one of the interviewer didn't find me to have hands-on experience. Overall experience. Thumbs up to HR team. They make whole recruitment process very convenient. Suggestion to Interviewer, if you are willing to evaluate candidate on specific programming language or technology it would be better conduct coding test on laptop or shared git project that expecting them to write full code on white board. Lesson learnt - One bad Interviewer can spoil your chances at good company."]
[u'LinkedIn is not the best when it comes to scheduling interviews, they cancel last minute, re-schedule and all that. It can impact your mindset for an interview. lot of situational questions for this role']
[u"I am not on the job market. Yet an internal recruiter contacted me via linkedin. I decided to do a quick tech with them to feel them out. They knew I have many years experience, so they arranged a senior person to conduct my interview. However, the question was extremely basic. So I was immediately turned off... I am fairly sure he had no idea of my background nor even looked at my resume. I did not even code the basic edge cases of handling null or empty input, because the interviewer kept interrupting me... Let me explain. I was logged into work on my normal machine, and so I had to use an auxiliary computer to do the tech interview... but that computer monitor is like 3 feet away from it's keyboard.. so i would type the line, then squint to look at it.. and before i could correct a typo, the interviewer would condescendingly indicate the line needed a correction."]
[u"The recruiter reached me in LinkedIn and we had a conversation about my background. After that he arranged me a one-hour phone screen in which there were two interviewers who had asked me several coding problems. After the phone screen they seem to satisfy my answers and decided to have me do the onsite interviews which was consisted with five rounds of interviews in all, two of which are about coding, one about design, one about projects that I've done and one with the manager."]
[u'I has two phone interviews before the last round. One with HR to discuss the role and expectations; and one with someone from the team. The second one included an excel exercise. Final round was a back-to-back six interviews with the team members. I gave a negative rate because I think back-to-back six interviews (each was around 50 minutes) were quite harsh as we did not give any breaks.']
[u'Interview process was carried out with two telephonic rounds and three rounds on site. Phone interviews include HR round and then the technical screening round. On site rounds focussed more on my resume and less on the job description. Things were pretty flexible as per my requirements.']
[u'Went through 3 interviews, first had phone interview and then was followed up by meeting with team members. There was no written test. Was very conversational. The interview process is much more difficult now.']
[u"I had my first phone interview with them. They seemed like nice poeple. But one of them was hired at linkedin a month before my interview and the other interviewer around 6 month before. I checked their background and they were almost new graduates from BS!! I have MS and couple of years of working experience. They asked me about my project and when I started talking about Weka algorithm and how I used it in my project, they were constantly asking what is WEKA?!! I was surprised that they didn't even know about that. Then they asked two questions. First was too simple, but they were trying to exaggerate it. I solved it with two different approaches. The second one was complicated but the issue was my internet connection got lost at the beginning of that and I couldn't resolve the connection issue so couldn't code it but provided the solution verbally and explained to them that I didn't at all expect internet connection issues. The interviewer said my verbal solution is correct. I was so mad at Comcast at that time, we switched to a faster service and it apparently became worst. around 2 weeks later I got an Email from recruiter that I wasn't the best match! Seriously, they didn't even give me a second chance even though they knew it wasn't my fault. Anyway, overall being judged by a person who was hired a month ago at Linkedin right after collage, I didn't expect much more than this."]
[u'In general the first interview is a more open conversation, discovery over the phone followed by another interview either onsite or on the phone, focused more on skill set, experience etc. The 3th interview is most likely onsite or video if needed having a particular tast, a role play or a recruitment strategy for a particular role that is shared with you a couple of days before hand to have time to prepare. The last meeting can be with your manager especially if he is not based in Dublin. It is more of a final, confirmation chat.']
[u'Phone interview using online text editor - collabedit. Interviewer just asked me to connect to the text editor and provided the following task. I had to use my Java skills and write a code and next question was on how I will test this method My code: public static int revInt (int iNum){ if (iNum == 0) return 5; String sNum = Integer.toString(iNum); char c; StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(); for(int i = 0; i<sNum.length(); i++){ c =sNum.charAt(i); if (c==\'0\') c=\'5\'; sb.append(c); } return Integer.parseInt(sb.toString()); Test Cases: 1. Use 120096045 -> 125596545 2. Negative int (-1), throw exception 3. 0 -> 5 4. "abcd" 5 integer max 6. max+1 exception 7. doubme 8. flow 9. null']
[u'Decent interview process but it takes awhile for the recruiters to get back to you. I waited 3 weeks until HR told me i didn\'t get the job. They seem to "string" you along and no feedback was given. I felt disappointed in the end and I wish they could of told me a straight up that I didn\'t get the position. The process was mostly 2 phone interviews and 2 on-site interviews; mostly asked me about my experiences and behavioral questions. Nothing too out of the ordinary. I understand if they weren\'t allowed to give feedback, but for a company the prides itself as the forefront of hiringrecruiiting, they could of been more helpful and gave something more substantial.']
[u"LinkedIn interview process was smooth, well planned, hiring manager was actively engaged. Excellent experience. I wasn't offered the role, however I was very intrigued and apparently they were too as they just reached out to me for another role based upon the hiring manager's feedback."]
[u'Two phone screens and an in-person interview. After the phone screens I went to SF to meet with my future manager. We sat in a room and he asked me the standard interview questions. When we finished he asked me to do a mock sales presentation. He smiled and gave me feedback on my sales presentation. Little did I know I made a great friend that day.']
[u'One phone interview with a recruiter, then two onsite interviews (and I think a presentation?) with the program leads. The recruiter for the phone screen was in the program herself, so had only been doing recruiting for a month. She didn\'t seem to know what she was doing, and made the conversation very rigid and formal, which didn\'t really fit with LinkedIn\'s "culture." Took over 4 weeks to get back to me about scheduling a phone interview, and I had applied through an employee referral.']
[u"A smooth process - three stages: a 30' phone interview with HR, an informal call with hiring manager and others in her team, then a formal interview at the office with a manager and a director. All in all about 7-8 weeks. The feedback from the last stage was very thorough and kind even though it was not positive in the sense that they decided not to go ahead with the process. I really liked the approach at all times."]
[u'an interview with a recruiter and then a phone interview. The experience was awful. The interviewer was very rude and when I asked a few questions about the product they were working on he started to get angry. Phone was on speaker and when I was answering the questions a few guys were laughing. I finally asked him are you laughing at me and he said No they are laughing on something else. This is not professional.']
[u"Fairly straightforward phone screening, the only main issue I had was that I couldn't hear the interviewer very well. He asked some questions that I did not expect to be asked for the position. Overall I thought it was very straightforward phone screening."]
[u"Contacted via recruiter. Had a phone screen with HR, and then a phone screen with a Senior Developer. Then had an online code interview via CollabEdit (IF you're interviewing, I strongly recommend becoming familiar with CollabEdit before this step. It's... an interesting tool). Flew out there for an onsite. Everyone was very welcoming. Everyone new be my name and they greeted me with some welcoming swag. Flew back home and received a call two business days later with an offer. You need to be very comfortable with your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript during the on-site. If not, I'm sure this would be very difficult. Lots of whiteboarding."]
[u"Several Phone interviews and on-site interview. Questions involved Network, Security, Ports, Service, tcpdump, traceroute etc..Simple job and I got the job but something fell through. Recruite agency Talentburst used a company called Hire right to perform background check and verify an AS degree from 20 years ago that went out of business. I don't have the certificate but I had student loans from Salley Mae and Tax records. Keep in mind I had been programming for 20 years. sample code at github user thecount12. You can read about the code and the experience. Several things come to mind. Age Discrimination is top on my list."]
[u'Phone call with 2 recruiters, phone call with hiring manager, face to face interview with hiring manager, 3 x video conf calls with different people. Face to face with HR. video conf call with senior manager, video conf call with 2 x peers. Disappointed not to get the job after investing a lot of time in the lengthily interview process, (3 days off work and also 2 evenings for interviews. I asked for feedback as why I was not successful, but did not receive any details. Would have expected a little more from a company who excels in the recruitment space.']
[u'A recruiter responded to my initial application and lined up a introductory phone conversation. We talked briefly about my experience and interest in LinkedIn. The following week I did a phone interview with two Web Developers which covered some basics of my experience and skill-set. The next week then did two 45 minute coding sessions covering Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Ultimately I had to end the process as I was offered a position at another company before I could do an in person interview which LinkedIn stressed was a requirement for the job. They had previously expressed that I should contact them if my timeline changed. I did, but they were unable to accommodate my timeline.']
[u'Whole process took over two months. Two phone interviews and one on-site interview with three PMs. Interview questions were relevant and about daily challenges that the PMs tackle. It was a pleasant experience overall. If I compare this experience to the Google PM interview I had a month prior to the LI interview, I have to say that LI PMs were way more grounded and their approach was way more friendly.']
[u"The TBC process was smooth because the woman handling was very thorough. After that, working with recruiters was awful. Communication kept falling off and I was constantly following up. One recruiter told me the role was demoted to an AAM role. Then they told me there was in fact an AM role but I would have to reinterview from the beginning to be considered (after 4 months). Totally inefficient and unproductive for all involved. Then they just told me they're not interested. PS - when applying to jobs at Linkedin they redirect you to Jobvite...might try to apply there instead..."]
[u'I am very impressed with the overall experience although I did not get the job due to lack of experience in a certain area. It started off with a 30 min screening interview, followed by an on sight interview with the hiring manager. Everybody was very friendly and provided me with feedback as soon as they could. It is obviously a company that takes the hiring process very seriously, just what you would expect from LinkedIn.']
[u'The interview process was okay. I was asked to go through resume and explain why I choose my major, how do I like it. There are also some questions about data.']
[u'The recruiter will call you first and ask you whether you are interested their job opportunities. Then you submit your resume from the email link which sent by the recruiter. Recruiter will ask you a proper time for the phone interview. The interview is one hour. It will have two engineers from Linkedin ask you some questions.']
[u'Phone Screen: They followed the usual collabedit.com based shared document to write code for the given question. The interviewer was nice and had good communication skills. I bombed the interview, possibly due to the prompts required to answer the question. Their expectations are higher. No sour grapes here, the process is fair, better than other companies. With this out of the way, here is some feedback to LI itself: One important point, I realized was the fact that, any line you type on the screen is considered final. My thought process is to exercise my own code and find issues with it. The interviewer was immediately jumping in pointing out things. Holes in the logic should be fine to point out, but, leave a minute or two to let the person think. It is a tough(only for some people, obviously) thing to pull off a balance between showing the interviewer what you are thinking Vs. solving the problem itself. I feel that an experienced engineer can\'t simply survive a day not knowing some of the things the interviewer mentioned in my interview. I write decent C++ code day-in and day-out which is reviewed at a very high standard. So, rejection from LI was a damning indictment of my "coding skills". So, be prepared to feel the worst engineer on the planet for a good month or so, if you do get rejected.']
[u'I have received a message by one of the recruiters via LinkedIn. Started with a smooth phone call with recruiter, followed by 2 screening phone calls with Senior/Principal Designers. Process followed by executing a design task, which I had to complete in the next 6 days. After review I was invited to an onsite presentation, where you backed up your thinking and solution of the task as well as presented yourself and your prior work. After lunch the day followed by six 1 to 1 with several more Product/Design team members. Generally felt really nice and smooth. People were honestly great, positive and excited about their work.']
[u"I was contacted by a recruiter about three weeks after applying, then we had a phone screening which was quite basic; background questions about myself and my work experience. After a few weeks of waiting I was told I got through to the on site interview. Again, it took some time for them to send me the relevant information for the interview day but when the day came, it was very impressive. We arrived in and were given breakfast, then some speeches from the recruiters and the head of the program, then three half hour interviews, followed by dinner in their (impressive) dining area. Then we were given a tour of the city, and after meeting some of the existing members of the BLP team, we were taken to a bar for drinks and finger food. The day in itself was the most impressive I've been to in a year of interviewing, but again, I was left waiting for several weeks to hear about the status of my application, in spite of three promised dates which passed by. It's hard to judge the experience as it was so mixed. Everyone we met was extremely friendly and clearly very intelligent, and the day came at great expense to the company (including flights and accommodation), but being messed around by recruiters is quite annoying. Obviously it's a very stressful job but realistic estimates should be given, and I don't feel someone should have to wait for weeks on end to be told they didn't get the job."]
[u"Recruiter reached out to me and set me up for an interview. Emailed me prep material for the phone interview. I scheduled phone interview for a month later date. there were 2 engineers on the phone call. Their introductions were short and I kept mine short enough to get more time for the coding problem. They used collabedit for reviewing/sharing code. There was only one coding question followed by wrap up time so I can ask them questions. Entire interview lasted 1 hour. They asked me to explain my solution and it's space/time complexities. Asked me how I can improve it. (99% of the time the answer to improve time complexity is to compromise on space complexity. That means introduce a freaking hashmap in your solution). Overall decent experience."]
[u'Extensive hours spent interviewing without ever being told I did/did not get an offer; just went silent with no closure: Interviews: HR phone screen; hiring manager phone interview; 2 onsite live/1 telepresence (system failed); 1 more hiring manager discussion; 2 more telepresence interviews (system failed); 2 more onsite live and 1 telepresence. Was given every indication an offer would be made by HR the following week, then silence. I was really shocked that a company that touts its HR policies and culture as strengths was always slow to respond between stages and then had no closure with me at the end. Left me very unimpressed.']
[u'I reached out one recruiter from Linkedin with whom I had contact more than a year before because I was very interested on a new open position, she call me and the screening interview went very well, she put me through the hiring manager for another phone call. After 2 weeks, I decided to follow up on my application and I never heard back from them.']
[u'Was reached out through LinkedIn. Two days later had a phone interview with the main hiring manager for about 30 minutes. Another two days later had a peer interview for about an hour. A day later was asked to come for an on-site interview with three members of the team which overall lasted 4 hours.']
[u'First round is HR round .Which is just basic talk.The hr guys will be great and will help you out in whatever way they can. Then a collabedit round will be set up and they will use blue jeans for setting up the meeting . All this is fine and nothing to worry About. The question given to me was absurdly easy .. i dont even know why such an easy question was asked to guy having so much experience. The interviewer had a sheet in which a question was provided by hr and he explained it to me and started discussing.']
[u"I was contacted by recruiter via LinkedIn. After chatting and getting a feel, a phone screen was set up. Interviewer went over my background before starting the interview. The questions were very easy. See questions below. Like most mentioned, the questions are on Glassdoor. They recycle through the same questions. To be honest, i don't know what LinkedIn wants. Even with the most optimal best solution all explained out step by step covering all edge cases, they still said no after the phone screen. It's another thing if you have a doubt about missing something. I even wonder why they waste some of our times if they are not genuinely interested. The recruiter was great and fast about everything. I interviewed with LinkedIn a couple of years ago and ironically, it was the same story. Personally, I have just decided to never interview at LinkedIn again. I guess i am just not LinkedIn material. Maybe that's a good thing :) On to the next, life is short...."]
[u"Excellent interviewing experience. The interviewer was more interested in checking whether I was a culture fit and not just the skills I possessed. First round was a presentation round - topic of the presentation was 'what makes you, you' Second round was personal interview - They checked about the kind of work I had done in the past, asked me to describe some of the projects that I had done and also asked a lot of behavioral questions. Final round was a one on one with the hiring manager - This round was more of a conversation wherein they asked about my career plans and long and short term goals"]
[u'The process took around 2 months with excellent follow-up and careful preparation by all interviewers involved. I went through 4 Interviews mostly across VC including leaders overseas and internal teams.']
[u'Phone Interview: the interview asked to describe about current project and the automation I did. Then used codeit to post the programming questions. He gave hints but the time was not suffient to complete the program.']
[u'Applied via LinkedIn. Received response within a couple of days. Went through lengthy phone interview with recruiter. It seemed positive -- both my skill set and work philosophies seemed to be a match. Three days later however the recruiter got back to me and said "The Hiring Manager has reviewed your profile and notes from our discussion, and has decided that this particular role is not the ideal fit." Not to nitpick but I probably have more experience than the hiring manager/guy leaving the post. Years of live implementations, instruction and mentoring on the subjects, writing white papers, etc. pretty much shows my ability.']
[u"It's quite a strange interview. Before the interview, I received an e-mail said that I will be tested technical question, but when I actually got the phone interview. I got all the behavior questions including the following questions. The interviewer said there might be some technical questions next round. But it's still weird. I got totally different message what the interview is going to about which leads me to the totally different direction."]
[u'I submitted my resume online, talked to recruiter, and talked the hiring manager. I did not move on to the next round. The case question that hiring manager asked was ok. He was looking for a definite answer. So whatever I said, he would kindly say that not what he was looking for. Then he did give me his answer. I was more in a brainstorming mode.']
[u'Applied via Linkedin. Approached by a recruiter to schedule an interview. I had 5 years of software development experience, and there were two interviewers, one with 9 months of work exp and other one with 2 years of work experience. The style of interview was immature and they asked me silly programming questions, and pointing out syntax errors and indentations. I got completely frustrated as I started giving more importance to syntax than the logic.']
[u'Internal recruiter contacted me and set up a phone screen. The phone screen included a brief set of technical questions involving Linux and networking protocols. Following that there were two technical interviews, one of which was a coding exercise on collabedit. The last stage is an all day onsite interview consisting of 6 modules covering various topics. The interview process was very organized, personalized, and enjoyable. Feedback was very quick after each stage, and a generous offer was presented with little delay.']
[u"The interview process was really pleasant- I was contacted by a recruiter about the job on LinkedIn, who scheduled a phone screen for the next day. There were a couple of easy questions, and then she told me she was going to put me through. The second round was a technical phone screen with an actual engineer- simple questions: fizz buzz, export to CSV, pull some stuff out of logs and count it. Not a whole lot of data structures. Like, you had to know dictionaries and stuff for it, but no software engineering style questions. I emailed my recruiter some feedback about the interview, and she emailed me back to put me through to the last (onsite) round. This was scheduled, and they sent a car to pick me up because I don't drive. I met the coordinator, who introduced me to the first engineer I met with, who basically did a deep dive into all the stuff I knew about networking, UNIX, operating systems, parallelism, security, and other relevant stuff. The next engineer presented a case study, focusing on scalability of a simple system. Both engineers were really good at presenting the problems in a clear way."]
[u"Interviewer reached out on LinkedIn. I wasn't ready to move ahead with the process at that point of time. We followed up when I had a pending offer and decided to move ahead with the process. There were 2 phone rounds which covered standard interviewing questions followed by an onsite round. The onsite round was a day of 5 interviews along with a lunch interview with one of the engineers. Out of the 5 onsite rounds, 2 were meant to be coding rounds and 1 was meant to be a design round. The remaining 2 rounds surprisingly were meant to be technical discussions about my work experience and more architecture. The coding rounds were simpler than the phone interviews. The fact that the 2 technical interviews virtually covered the same architecture of my work experience was staggering in spite of me raising it with the second interviewer. The engineers I met were well-mannered and polite. However, the process in general wasn't the most organized one."]
[u'The recruiter I spoke to was extremely nice and was pleasant to talk to. She asked me about my education and where I have had coordinator roles in my past experiences. However after the interview I kept getting passed around from recruiter to recruiter saying they will help me but my follow up emails were mostly left unanswered.']
[u'I was contacted for a phone interview by a LinkedIn Recruiter, who offered a time to undertake the interview that I was unable to attend. Therefore, I quickly replied with a counter time in the future to which I received no reply until days after the suggested time. Despite this unfortunate start, the interview (which we undertook via Skype) was fair with many interesting questions.']

[u"Got contacted by HR on LinkedIn. Didn't have a call with her, just a few questions over mail. Standard question with a bit of a difference. Prepare well for the recently asked questions, LinkedIn repeats questions in telephonic interview."]
[u"This is the first year they were offering the program (Summer 2015), so the interview process is likely to change. There were three stages. Recruiter call, call with one PM, back to back calls with one PM each. First call was to gauge interest and see if I could talk about a product that I liked. Second call was talking about extending a LinkedIn product and strategies to check to see if this hypothetical add on would work. The hypothetical product building gets more and more detailed and more parameters are added on until the interviewer is satisfied. Third and fourth calls were more of the same, except they also asked about products made by other companies and monetization of these new products. Called me a day after the final interviews to tell me that I wouldn't get an offer."]
[u'I applied through a recruiter. The process took 3 weeks. The worst interview experience i have ever had. The interviewers are extremely rude and some of them cannot even speak or understand english. Questions were simple and I answered well. The office space is also extremely cramped and i could not picture myself working there.']
[u'Interview Process was very laid back and informal. I had to be rescheduled a couple times before I got my last interview, but overall had a good experience. I built a long-lasting relationship with my recruiter - she was what drew me into the company initially and made the process less stressful.']
[u'Took 2+ days. Just had the first phone screen. asked about some basic sysadmin question, such as what command do you use when you want to do something or similar stuff like that. And some network questions such at what is the name of the protocols for blahblah... Interviewer was very nice and patient.']
[u"45min regular technical phone screen. Questions were from basic programming concepts and linux commands. two interviewers present on the phone screen. I had to run behind the recruiter to get the result and they didn't provide any feedback on interview performance."]
[u'1. A recruiter contacted me asking if I\'d be interested in discussing opportunities. 2. Phone Screen with recruiter 3. Follow up call + emails setting up 2 phone interviews with design directors I\'d be reporting to (Hiring Managers) 4. 2x45 min Portfolio reviews + phone interviews with design directors 5. Follow up call + emails with invitation for on site visit & take home design exercise instructions. 6. On site interview visit, which included: a. One hour presentation about myself as a designer & human, including presenting my solution to the take-home design design homework - to an open -invitation interview panel, followed by questions. b. 4x45 min 1-on-1 interviews with design managers from different teams. 7. Offer. NOTE: Every step of the way, LinkedIn recruiters erred on the side of over-communicating every detail, from providing links to the profiles of the people I\'d be interviewing with to connecting me with a "mentor" to discuss my project with. They were also very responsive and figured out how to rapidly schedule calls inside of my schedule. In the end, the well-orchestrated interview process is what tipped the scales to LinkedIn over other options on the table, including Google, Intuit, and Facebook.']
[u'Recruiter reached out to me. I responded, but didn\'t hear back. After a few days, I reached out to the recruiter again. She apologized because she had "missed" my original email. Anyway, we set up a time to chat. The conversation was more in-depth than typical recruiter calls. There were a couple of times where she asked me a question that I had already answered within the conversation. She clearly wasn\'t listening. Also got the impression that she didn\'t know very much about design. She was very disconnected. The turn-off for me was that there were many parts of our conversation where she was literally reading from a script. It was obvious . . . and strange. She contacted me the following day to tell me that I wasn\'t going to move forward in the process. Overall, it felt like a very poor recruiting experience. She was clearly incompetent as a recruiter. I\'m excellent at what I do, having 10+ years of experience, and she blew it. I\'m happy that it didn\'t work out. LinkedIn was the worst recruiting experience that I\'ve ever had!']
[u"A recruiter contacted me about a week after replying, he was really kind and made the process very straightforward. It started with a phone screen with the recruiter and then I scheduled a technical interview with one of the engineers. I didn't pass that round, but the recruiter was very nice about getting the news to me."]
[u"Fairly easy process and the recruiter gave me prompt feedback too. Phone interviews as I wasn't in the area at the time. A few standard interviews and no trick questions. It was not stressful and the interviewer mainly asked about my past experiences and my understanding of LI."]
[u'The process consisted of a phone screen, then a technical phone interview, and then I was brought onsite. I was most impressed by the professionalism of all the recruiters. They are definitely looking for candidates with a good amount of experience since their program is relatively small compared to other companies like Facebook, Google, Microsoft, etc.']
[u"Pros: The people I interviewed with were really nice and really excited about the company. They asked a lot of really good questions and really went in depth with my background and skills. Cons: The process was long. Sometimes I wouldn't hear back from the recruiter in over a week and would have to follow up with them. This didn't happen once but at least three times. I accepted another offer since their process took longer than most companies."]
[u"Was contacted by a recruiter and then took part in a phone screen, followed by an informal group interview off-site, then an all-day onsite interview. They made the whole process streamlined and enjoyable. The three all-day interviews weren't too difficult, and they went to great lengths to make all the candidates as relaxed and comfortable as possible."]
[u'Got an email from recruiter saying he reviewed my profile and is interested in having a quick discussion regarding my past experience. I had a call from him and we discussed about the role as well as my previous experience. He scheduled 2 telephonic interviews in the next week. Telephonic interviews were with Web Development Managers and each had a question which is to be solved on collabedit. I was not selected for further rounds.']
[u"Applied through a staffing agency. Two rounds - One Phone call and One In-Person Phone call Was supposed to be for 20 minutes but the interviewer doesn't care about interviewee's time, so it went on for almost 70 minutes. Questions were based on deep technical knowledge and almost 20 questions on HR side.. Face to Face interview Worst experience. They don't have plans to accommodate parking or receiving the candidate.. Lost almost an hour.. Two technical rounds with four engineers. Engineers there have great enthusiasm but don't want to listen to your answers since they've their own calendar appointments. One of them was repeatedly, asking me to write a program to store strings in an array. And since the solution was pretty fast, he started digging too much into the basics of JVM and Computer Architecture. There were two or three technical questions to answer but didn't matter. Got a vibe that they are not interested in interviewing, so wrapped up soon and left. Result Made me wait for 21 days before they said, they put the position on indefinite hold; 6 weeks later, they wanted to interview me again, since one of the team members was off to vacation(Labor Day weekend). One week before the schedule, the staffing firm conveys that the position was filled internally."]
[u'I was contacted by a recruiter on my LinkedIn. I responded with interest, and she scheduled a brief phone screen. She then emailed me with many helpful links on LinkedIn technologies and coding and interview tips. The next day the recruiting coordinator emailed with my technical phone interview details. I had a phone interview with 2 senior engineers that involved coding in real-time. The next day I received word that they will not be further pursuing me as a candidate. The whole process was quick as well as pleasant. All people I spoke with were friendly and respectful.']
[u'A recruiter messaged me on linkedin and invited me to the info session on campus. I went there and I fell in love with company and the program. Next I went for an onsite interview and I did a follow up phone interview after that.']
[u'I was contacted by an internal recruiter and had three rounds of phone interviews with various team members. After the third round I did an on-site interview at the Mountain View office. I was warmly welcomed and taken to a (very) small interview room with a whiteboard and two chairs. I met five or six people for about a half hour each. Questions ranged from technical, though not too specific, to a few brain teasers. Nothing at all unreasonable. I was given ample opportunity to ask lots of questions of the interviewers and found that everyone was both really nice and very bright. Mid way through the day we had lunch at the awesome cafeteria and took a stroll around the buildings.']
[u'It was a phone screening for summer intern, and asked about the previous background and the self-evaluation of R and other programming language ability. Just some basic questions,such as the current GPA, the visa sponsor issue, the location preference, the previous experience, and the hr is very nice.']
[u"Employee Referral 4+ weeks two phone interviews each with two engineers engineers are helpful to be honest all their interview questions can be online here in glassdoor and in careercup just be prepared and dont stress over it , i know it's easy to say but hard to do :)"]
[u'I have my first phonic round in which I was asked about fork, http. I submitted my answers and now waiting for the second round to happen. The interviewer was very came and it was pretty good experience with them']
[u'Two phone screens then onsite. Phone screens were very easy, onsite was a bit challenging as they asked me to troubleshoot a live issue with other SREs. Overall the interview process was good and quick. The recruiters kept me updated all the time. One of the few interviews I really enjoyed giving.']
[u'Similar to other people. Contacted me on LinkedIn for phone interview. Got it done quickly because i was expecting other offers soon. Scheduled back to back 45 min code interviews using colabedit. Felt really rushed. People left in the middle of my interview to catch a bus!']
[u'2 rounds of pre-screening by HR 2 rounds of initial interview with cross-functional team member and hiring manager 3 rounds of second interview with 5 cross-functional team members 1 final interview/presentation with panel Overall, the process moved quickly and was intense. HR followed up within 24-48 hrs after each round of interviews to check in and provide feedback. Questions were straightforward and did not attempt to trick you.']
[u'talked about my research and when i would defend my thesis. Interviewer was very friendly and handled questions well. Was given some open ended questions and answered them via email. Then had a phone screen where they tried to get a feel for me, again no technical questions asked just questions regarding the size of datasets I have worked with and what I did with them.']
[u"Overall, it was a good experience for me, as it was my first interview in Silicon Valley. Everyone was very smart and helpful along the way. I initially had a recruiter reach out to me via LinkedIn, a surreal experience for sure. I spent an hour chatting with my recruiter about the position and LinkedIn. I expressed some concern over relocation and she was wonderful explaining relocation and how they eased that pain. There was a lull, as it was around the holidays, but we ended up scheduling a two 45-minute phone interviews. They both called on time and we went through my portfolio, as well as some general questions about my design process. They each talked about different things, which was great. I was asked to come on-site, and again I was hesitant about wasting time if I wasn't able to move. My recruiter actually put me in touch with another designer who moved from my home state, and we ended up talking for an hour. The extra effort was great and convinced me I wanted to do the on-site. During this time, my recruiter quit and I was passed on to a new one. That transition went smoothly as it could. I was given a week to complete a design exercise. I spent 8-10 hours on it and in retrospect, should have done more. After some travel delays, I made it out to Mountain View for the interview. I was greeted after signing in and was given a very quick tour. I was then set up in a room to give an hour long presentation about myself, my work, and the design exercise. There were about 15-20 people in the room, along with some remote folks. There were a lot of questions back and forth. I knew they had time to prepare their thoughts about where my design exercise failed, wish I'd been prepared too! Then we went directly into a more casual lunch 1-on-1. I wanted more time with this, as I was really getting to learn more about the everyday life as a designer at LinkedIn. I was then in a room for four back to back 45 minute interviews with senior designers from different departments. It was a mixed bag, as some I felt more comfortable with than others. The first interview was via a video conference, while the other 3 were in person. We spent a lot of time going over my design exercise. Every person used the whole 45 minutes and by the last interviewer, I was pretty exhausted. About a week passed, and I was given a phone call that I didn't have enough experience for what they were looking for. I appreciated the phone call and feedback. They said to stay in touch and reach out in 6 months-year, which I found encouraging."]
[u"One programming phone interview, 2 questions. Onsite interview was the longest I've ever been to, but they did a great job of making it fun, and I was not tired by the end."]
[u"I only did two phone interviews, a recruiter screened me and than I had a technical phone interview. I didn't continue because an offer came in that I preferred over LinkedIn. The phone interview consisted of some pretty standard brain teasers and a more interesting data wrangling question."]
[u"I applied online via LinkedIn, and the recruiter contacted me for an initial touch base and setup the first phone screen. The interview wasn't tough. There were 2 senior engineers who asked couple of test downtime questions. And then came the Coding part, where i was asked to print a level order of a binary tree in a tree format. I solved the first part of the problem with a recursive approach in 2 minutes, but got stuck on printing it like a tree, as the recursive approach made it more difficult to put the line breaks at right places. The interviewer was giving hints, but it was already too late and then i was asked to write sample test cases for the same. After couple of days got an email from HR that i didn't pass the screen. But would definitely recommend the company and wish All the best for future employees!!"]
[u'One telephonic interview followed by onsite. The onsite interviewers were very professional. They had good set of questions to ask, the niter process took around 3-4 weeks but you ca request to expedite the process. The interviewers in general make you at ease. There will be typically two interviewers in a panel.']
[u"1st contact: a contact introduced me to someone in HR, who I personally meet, and he kindly assessed the role more ad hoc for my profile, and introduced me via e-mail to the related recruiter. 3 days later: -1st. interview: by phone, HR asked some questions on my experience (30 mins). 7 days later: -2nd interview: by phone, the potential manager asked behavioral questions and concrete examples from my job experience (45 mins). 2 months later (once they confirmed that the position was open). -3rd. interview: I went to Dublin and had an interview with an analyst, the manager, and the head of sales operations. The technical part (excel) could not be properly done as the computer they gave me didn't work, so I had to explain the formulas to use and the way I would manipulate the data. This 3rd. interview was very well organised by HR in terms of indicating me the agenda's details and arranging the flights & taxis, even though that the time window between the flight's arrival/departure flights was really short. Until here, everything seemed to be ok... but I did not receive any follow-up message. Until I sent the 3rd message (more than 3 weeks after flying to Dublin) HR e-mailed me back informing me I was not selected as they found someone more experienced, and inviting me to keep in touch for other opportunities and to give them a call for more feedback details. I tried calling them, but my HR contact was not reachable... The fact that I had to insist so much for an update was discouraging."]
[u'the second round of question phone interview applied through campus career fair get the interview about 2 weeks after, the first phone interview 1 hour and second two 1 hour interview in a row']
[u'For a social networking company, I\'m disappointed in the poor communication skills and disorganized interview processes. Contacted by a LinkedIn recruiter via LinkedIn InMail message. Received a list of questions to answer via e-mail to prior to first phone call with the recruiter. When I talked to the recruiter over the phone, she hadn\'t read any of my responses whatsoever, and proceeded to ask the questions over the phone. She then said she doesn\'t think they have a fit for me, but she\'ll put me through the process anyways, just in case. SHE was the one who contacted ME in the first place, based on my LinkedIn profile, which exactly reflects what\'s on my resume. I was then handed to an interview coordinator who scheduled me for a technical phone screen with a junior/senior software engineer duo. My phone screen was postponed, and the coordinator asked for available time slots in order to reschedule. I sent my response to the coordinator and CC\'d the recruiter who initially contacted me. I received an out-of-office response from the coordinator, with the contact information for a backup coordinator. I resent my response to all three (recruiter, original coordinator, and backup coordinator). I didn\'t hear back for a day, and thought they were having issues finding engineers who could make the time slots. I then received e-mail from the recruiter saying she needed a response. I double-checked the e-mail addresses on my previous e-mail, and everything was correct. I forwarded it to all three people again. The next day, I received an e-mail from the original coordinator with the same urgent request. Again, I forwarded my time slots to the same three people. A day later, I finally received the names of another junior/senior duo and a confirmed time slot. When the phone screen finally happened (10 minutes late), I was contacted by someone entirely different. He was under the impression that I knew who he was. I got a vibe that there was someone else in the conference room with him. My time was cut short, as the interviewer was being kicked out of the conference room. As others have mentioned, LinkedIn obviously has an interview question repository. Reviewing practice questions from Career Cup will help. Phone screen consisted of a series of programming puzzles to be done over Collabedit. In my opinion, these questions had absolutely nothing to do with the job I was contacted for, and had little relevance to anything LinkedIn does. The job titles at LinkedIn appear to be horribly skewed. Most senior-level software engineering jobs in Silicon Valley are for 10+ years of professional experience. The two senior level engineers I was originally scheduled to talk to had only two years of experience, and were hired at LinkedIn straight out of college. The senior engineer I ACTUALLY talked to mentioned that he interned at LinkedIn the previous year. I find no comfort in the idea that a company, such as LinkedIn, can run the Engineering department with "senior software engineers" that practically just graduated from college (without even a Masters degree to bump the years in experience). Rejection e-mail bad a vague, "Your experience doesn\'t fit any of our open positions," response. In reality, nothing was asked of me in the technical phone screen to actually determine this. I wish I had actually read some of the interview reviews on Glassdoor before I started this process. I probably never would have bothered responding to the recruiter in the first place.']
[u"Phone interview at first. Then if you qualify they'll call back for an on site interview. Pretty cut and dry you make the cut you're in. When you get there there will be two 30 min interviews and a 60 sixty minute assessment ."]
[u"I was first contacted by recruiter by linkedin message. I applied online, then he wanted to talk to me on the phone (he said he wanted to talk about role and my background). On the phone, he asked about those, then suddenly he gave me a short test, networking and linux command, I wasn't ready for it, thus I couldn't answer most of them. After a day, he informed me that they decided not to proceed."]
[u'At first, I was pleasantly surprised by LinkedIn\'s personalized and enthusiastic recruitment. I was internally referred for a role within their Talent Management space and pretty quickly contacted by their recruitment team to move forward. However mid-way through the recruiting process, they completely dropped the ball and I was left with a very unfavorable view of the company. I had a brief phone screen with the initial recruiter and right away could pick up that she was a contractor and didn\'t know much about the role or the culture. It seemed like she was reading off a template of sorts, which I\'m sure is the case, but very forced and unnatural. However, she was pleasant and eager to move me forward to talk with the hiring manager of the role on-site Hiring manager on-site visit was a nice surprise. I was welcomed at their office with a little goodies baggie and my own personal LinkedIn mapping based on my profile. Compared to other interview experiences, I thought this was a great buy-in to working on their team. The rest of the on-site was pretty standard, it went well and she was very excited to bring me on to for the final on-site interviews with several others. She walked me out and said she\'d like to move forward pretty quickly. I left thinking I would hear form the recruiter within a few days. A full week and a half passed and I heard nothing. I reached out to the recruiter in charge and waited days before hearing back anything. When the recruiter finally reached out, she seemed very overstretched and frazzled, as if this role was a bottom-tier priority for her, which might have been the case but should never be felt by the candidate. Over a month later, I was brought on for on-sites. I was only given the confirmed interviewers the day before and found out upon arrival that one had canceled. The recruiter host at the office did not even seem like she was ready for my arrival, and was very late to greet me and take me to the room for my first session. The office wing I was in was completely dark and uninhabited, as if it was being cleared out for demolition. Not a very positive start. There was no warm welcome, there was not even water offered. My first interviewer was still late, and time of the interview that I was told was different from what she was told. I was under the impression we had 45mins, she thought just 30, and was 10mins late because she didn\'t know which room I was in. The last interview was the hiring manager\'s manager, and she seemed like she was extremely rushed and didn\'t really have the time to conduct the interview. She seemed stressed and it was a pretty formal, stiff interview. She even commented on the fact that there were several key things missing, such as an iPad with my day\'s schedule and interviewers. She seemed more concerned with the fact that I didn\'t get the iPad then the fact that i was interviewing to join her team. It seemed like there was a lot of back end chaos going on that no one wanted to admit to, and that they wanted to sell me on loving their job and loving the "challenge" of working in such an environment, but that it was a hot mess right now. I did not get a good vibe from her at all and I did not leave that experience feeling good about the team, the work environment or the role. I did not hear back from the recruiter for quite some time. I was pretty turned off by the last half of the candidate experience, so I was not even will to consider accepting, should I even have been given the offer. I waited again for weeks, and finally had to reach out several times to close the loop. I eventually got an email, not a call, but an email confirming I would not be made an offer. That was fine with me, however, the email itself was extremely insensitive and slightly insulting. It was pretty pretentious and I was doubly confirmed that this was not the environment for me. I\'ve learned since then that I am not alone on having a pretty poor candidate experience, as several other colleagues I\'ve talked with since then have come out and shared the same "dropping of the ball right in the midst of being considered". It\'s a shame that for a company that prides itself on being the #1 recruiting platform for the world, it is substantially suffering from an inconsistent candidate experience that is only hindering it\'s own internal search for talent.']
[u"Someone from the Bangalore team interviewed me for the first round and then there were four technical and three non technical interviews from US. I cleared all the rounds and was asked to come for an onsite interview. The HR told me it's all positive till now and the only formality is to meet the team here in Bangalore who would be interviewing me, asking non-technical questions. The interviews went well and it looked positive when I left their office. However, after a few days the HR sent an email mentioning that I'm not shortlisted. I was in ambush and mentioned that everything was positive according to her. She said the team has chosen someone else that they were interviewing. The head of the HR mentioned that this is not right and she had escalated the issue to the management; clearly it does not make sense to reject the candidate just because they found someone else later in the stage. I'm still waiting for the head of HR to call me and let me know what happened to the escalation. At least they owe an apology."]

But I simply accepted their interview. 1st one is a phone interview, just asked basic situation and scheduled a coding interview. 2nd one is a coding interview, a senior called me on the phone and use collabedit to do the coding. She asked me some CSS/Javascript basic knowledge questions for 30 mins and gave me a coding question for another 30mins. The experience is good because the recruiter is so kind and did very good follow up."]
[u"TERRIBLE - SHOCKINGLY BAD! 4 STAGES: 1 - Initial coffee with HR & potential line manager. 2 - Subsequent briefing for a role play and phone call with line manager 'in role play' mode (I had to pretend I worked for them and that they were an external client) 3 - Roll Play style presentation in person to 3 senior individuals - 45 mins, then 45 mins for further Q&A 4- After 4 hours of interviews, plus time required for me to prepare presentations, I NEVER heard from them. They didn't even say they weren't going to take me forward, just went silent. I'm 10 years into my career so while I can understand not coming back to graduate candidates (kind of) I was very surprised by their lack of etiquette towards more experienced professionals. Problems 1 - the briefing wasn't in line with what the interviewers were expecting, even though I'd discussed it with one of them on a call 2 days prior. This meant that in person they were ill prepared and disappointed by the limited scope of my presentation. Totally embarrassing for me! 2- Was asked to come into present 1 week in advance (quick but fine) however two days before it turned out they were expecting a formal presentation with PPT deck. This wasn't in the brief that HR had given me. I sought out the ppt template from them and got one in Spanish with formatting oddities that took ages to correct and were still commented on negatively during the interview 3- The interviewers were trying to be nice but one of them was really rude. He sat opposite me writing a list of my 'strengths' and 'weaknesses' (mostly the latter) in big writing that I could read throughout the interview. It was off putting - not sure if he was doing this on purpose to put me off. Clearly I was the wrong person for the role, and while they tried to be nice about it the lack of consistency between the briefing and expectations of the interviewers was missing causing major embarassment for me. Add to that the weird in-room behaviour of one of them, and the fact that no one from HR ever followed up (despite promising to, and me emailing them)... definitely the least professional and most unpleasant interview experience of my career. This was a massive waste of time, deeply miserable and the irony of this being at a company who profess to be professional isn't lost on me...!"]
[u"I got a phone interview about two weeks after I dropped off my resume at a career fair on campus. The interviewer is nice but I just don't know my stuff for SRE."]
[u"3 phone interviews followed by a front interview (was needed to re-locate so first they had me go through all sorts of phone conversations). The questions were basic but done thoroughly - you can't talk your way out of it, these guys know what it's all about. before entering the interview, look up all there is to know regarding the company, nice CV and a good personality is not enough!"]
[u'Recruiter contacted me via LinkedIn InMail. Then after 2 week had my introductory round. After 2 week again had same introductory round from the same recruiter. then he scheduled Technical phone interview. It went good. Interviewer was asking increasing question difficulty gradually. Then they scheduled 2 Code interview of 45-45 min on collabedit. Unfortunately half an hour before my coding interview i receive email that position has been filled.!']
[u'Phone Interview. The young lady that spoke with me told me she had just been rotated into the interviewing job, but was looking forward to talking with me. She noticed that I had taken and passed the LinkedIn Recruiter certification test that they administer. She was very interested until about 10 minutes into the interview when she said "Wow, you have a lot of experience and job history." After that she said we were nearing the end of our allotted time. When I asked what the next step was, she said that they had already hired someone and that I was a backup interview in case that person did not work out. Note: I actually waited almost two months before posting this review. Since then the position has been posted several times (I realize they might have multiple positions), the young lady that interviewed me has left LinkedIn, and my business relationship officer has left LinkedIn as well.']
[u"Got a phone interview from HR, and did not hear anything back ever since. Don't know if the interview process need to take so long. The HR said there will be some follow up interviews but has not heard anything back for over 3 weeks."]
[u'The first phone call talks about the my projects and experience. And it took a few days before I got a technical phone interview scheduled in three week. The technical interview happened on collabedit. It was not very hard. The coding questions were kind of typical. I am still waiting for the next technical interview.']
[u"Referred through a contact. Had two phone screens followed by a half day of interviews which went reasonably well except for one. Followed up with the recruiter a couple times after the interviews with no response. I am totally fine with hearing that I didn't get it but very unprofessional to not respond to emails - doesn't reflect well on a company who prides themselves on being the place to go for recruiting etc."]
[u'Interview process started by a recruiter contacting me on LinkedIn and scheduled a phone interview. The interview questions weren\'t hard, the interviewer was expecting the solution to be in certain fashion, when i am writing code and explaining him a different way I do it, he doesn\'t want to hear, kept interrupting me with his questions before I finish what I have to say, which is very annoying and I lost my interest in explaining it to him and I told him I will write the code and if it doesn\'t work we can discuss, looks like he wasn\'t interested in code until he understood the logic. So, all in all, it wasn\'t a great interview. Coming to the LinkedIn\'s recruiting part. They suck, absolutely bad hiring process and communications. 3 years ago I interviewed for LinkedIn and I didn\'t get through their phone screen, once phone screen is done the recruiter never gets back to you with anything. I emailed him multiple times, no reply, I called him, no reply and after 5 weeks, he replies with "we are not interested and will not be moving forward". LinkedIn needs 5 weeks to get feedback for your phone screen sounds "reasonable time". This time I didn\'t bother to even ask the recruiter about feedback. I personally decided not to interview with them anytime in future again.']
[u'I applied through a Recruiter on Linkedin , the process was pretty fast. She got back to me quickly and directly scheduled a Phone interview with an Engineer in their test team ( I was actually told that there would be two interviewers , but only one of them was on the line ). The interviewer was terrible and showed no genuine interest in gauging my capabilities. It felt like she was reading from a teleprompter. We had dead silence for over 30 mins when I was trying to solve the coding question over collabedit !']
[u"HR contact me through linkedin, scheduled 2 phone interviews, pass both and move to the onsite interview, which consist of 6 back to back interviews, starting from 10am till 4pm. There are 3 technical interviews(coding skill, algorithm, system design) and 3 non-technical interviews(communication skills, lunch, and talk with the hiring manager) Generally speaking all interview questions are not super hard and most of them are reasonable, the only thing that may affect your performance is that there's no time to rest, it's basically 6 hours back to back interview except the lunch. The lunch is lead by a senior enginner, we did a lot of chatting, which made me even more exhausted. I'd suggest that if Linkedin can setup a 30min break time after lunch, that would help the candidates to relax and gain some stemina back because the 2 interviews after the lunch are both technical."]
[u'1. Phone call with Talent Acquisition Advisor 2. Face to Face interview with Supervisor 3. Video Conference with Manager and Support Specialist Process took roughly 6-12 weeks, had to reschedule a few times for the initial phone interview and feedback for the next stage took over nearly 4 weeks. Before a face to face interview to be booked in.']
[u'Referred by a friend. 2 hour interview with hiring manager and 2 team members. Included "sales pitch" to hiring manager, selling LinkedIn products to clients. Fairly straightforward. They\'re not looking for product knowledge as much as they are for your sales style. They want to know what questions you\'d ask the potential customer to understand their pain points and how LinkedIn can solve these.']
[u'2 phone call interviews, first with recruiter and the second with team manager. Then I went in for face to face with manager and another team member. Different interview process from what I expected, most questions were based on scenarios on what I would do in LinkedIn rather than what I have done in my past jobs. It was about 1.5 hours in total and they gave a good insight of where the company is going and what the specific team goals were, very transparent conversation.']
[u'I applied for the job position. After 2 days I received an email in which they asked me the convenient time for a phone interview. I made the interview 1 week later. The interview duration was almost 20 minutes. The HR was late but she sent me an email. She was very kind and informal.']
[u'Got contacted by the recruiter and schedule two rounds of technical phone interviews. first round was on time, but the second round the interviewer canceled in the last minute, and no one told me until I waited over 30 minutes. after the second round I got a thank you email. the recruiter and one of the engineer had a heavy accent which made things a little more difficult. the interview process was the same, first the engineer will tell you what their role is at LinkedIn and they will ask you about a most interesting recent project. they seemed to ask it because they were told to and not because they wanted to know about it. After that it was typical coding algorithm problems. some were harder than the other. If you took too much time solving one question and ended up not getting multiple questions it probably means you will not proceed to the next round. expect to solve two to three problems.']
[u"Applied online, got reply in one week, 15 minute recruiter interview to discuss why I decided to major in CS, my interest in LinkedIn, my summer availablity, what facilities LinkedIn provides to interns and about LinkedIn's two engineering divisions."]
[u"Contacted by recruiter; initial phone screening scheduled quickly. Next steps to interview with hiring manager, and that call was also scheduled quickly. Recruiter was responsive after interview even though I didn't receive an offer."]
[u"Submitted my application through my school's career portal as they came to recruit on campus. I was contacted for a phone interview and I responded promptly, letting them know that I had a few outstanding offers and needed to expedite my process, but he didn't get back to me until I sent a follow-up email a week later. The recruiters for this rotational program are apparently in the program and were hired just the year before, so I cut him so slack. The phone interview went very well, however, I never heard from them again after that. No email, nothing. So unprofessional."]
[u"I was contacted by a linkedin recruiter on linkedin. Had a quick phone screen with the recruiter, who made a fantastic job of selling the position to me. I then had to do an online set of coding exercises which I describe below. I didn't find it too hard, but I do have a problem with writing code / think in front of people in pressure settings such as an interview. The experience was positive, minus one minor thing for one of the questions where I felt the interviewer was confused as to what was expected and did not clarify. Instead, he simplified the problem, which made me insecure as to what result that would have. The coding exercise was done on a collabedit instance while on the phone with the Senior SRE. Both people I spoke to had a nice positive and friendly tone. I would like to try again in the future."]
[u"Phone screening interview. They introduced themselves, gave a (very) brief description of the position, and then just asked typical qualifying questions. I think they could have done a better job asking questions that actually were relevant to a candidate's experience, instead of all canned answers. Nothing gave the impression that they had any unique questions for the interview, either original or follow-on questions throughout the process."]
[u'Applied on LinkedIn website, got a call back from the recruiter the next day. Did a phone screening and was selected for a technical interview. The interview questions are mostly about case questions and technical-behavioral questions, such as given the total number of LinkedIn users, how much impressions did LinkedIn impressions were prompted? Mostly testing your knowledge of LinkedIn customer market and analytical ability.']
[u'Applied online, phone screening, went on site for a sales pitch. 2 people interviewed and they seemed to not really ask too many questions about me or relevant experience. I felt like it was rushed and not professional.']
[u"1. Phone screen with recruiter 2. 45 minute phone interview with the hiring manager 3. Onsite 4 hour interview with 4-5 people for approx 45 minutes each 4. 2nd onsite interview for about 4 hours + presentation I like LinkedIn as a company and think they have good potential. However, I think their hiring process is a bit too cumbersome. For a company that tries to make it easy for you to display your expertise and potentially get passively recruited by other companies, their hiring process is too time-consuming. I think they can do a better job to be mindful of a professional's time. To have 2 onsite interviews lastly 4 hours each is a big drain on someone's time, in addition to requiring a presentation that can take a candidate 10-20 hours to put together. I really think that's not respectful of a working professional's time to go through multiple of these hoops. I've interviewed at startups (series A small companies, Dropbox, Square, Pinterest) and large companies like Google, Facebook, and I think LinkedIn Head of Recruiting should really internalize and think about how they are setting up their process and whether it's mindful of a working professional. Certainly, the recruiters I've worked with there are professional and friendly, and during your onsite they give you a giftbag and welcome message on the whiteboard, so all those small tokens are nice, but they don't make up for the high hours necessary for a professional to recruit at LinkedIn."]
[u'One hour phone interview, at first I cannot hear the recruiter clearly and then she called in with another phone number. Thus the whole interview took 40 minutes. The interview began with a self-introduction. a few questions and a coding problem, then some follow up questions.']
[u"Except for 2 interviewers, I enjoyed the whole process. They are looking for the candidate with the right skills and fit. It's a long process, they do bounce candidates around different teams. The one guy I was pissed about was who asked me a question and did not bother to listen to my response. He was busy typing in his laptop and said he has a meeting afterwards and was preparing for that. I had to answer the question 3 times to get his attention. Extremely arrogant and it did kill my enthusiasm. Secondly they also ask puzzles which doesn't correlate with your skills necessary for the job."]
[u"I got this interview through a recruiter through LinkedIn website. It was a one hour phone interview. They asked about my work in the first 10 minutes. The interviewers were nice, they were on time and they described their role in the company. They didn't talk much during the interview. The recruiter replied by email after two days. After writing the code they asked me about test cases."]
[u'Applied online After a few weeks, Got a phone call from recruiter and phone screen with the lead of analytics team Scheduled the phone screening with the manager Then had a time talking to the manager Waited for the results coming out for like 10 days']
[u'Got contacted by recruiter via LinkedIn, scheduled a half an hour "talk" with him. Then he passed me to higher interviews. Had a total of 3 technical, 45mins long interviews. I didnt have a lot of javascript experience and they rejected me because of that. The recruiters and linkedin employees were super nice and answered alot of questions regarding the company itself.']
[u'refer by a friend and got the phone interview from hr. They change the interviewer suddenly and does not let me know. then re-schedule, a manager asked me two questions, one is colon a tree for mirror, another one is text justification, the second one is not a easy one. I am sure I solve it correctly; however, 3 days passed, no message from hr. then I send message to the recruiter to find out the answer. one day passed , the recruiter give me response that i am failed the interview. Then I ask the reason why I failed at the interview, no email comes back......that surprise me, I need a reason for that unreasonable decision!']
[u'I was contacted by someone within the Talent Acquisition Team (Global Sales Org) after applying to an open position posted on LinkedIn. She had asked for times and dates for an initial interview/chat. I was quite happy that my application was acknowledged (as often applying online just sucks you into a black hole of no response), and provided several days and times. No response after a week. None. Nada. Just the level of unprofessionalism, I would not have expected from a site that purports to "connect professionals to make them more productive and successful." Actions certainly speak volumes. Bullet dodged.']
[u"Made it all the way to the onsite. Every interviewer seemed either not really personable, rude, or weren't very interested in me. The first interview had to be rescheduled because they forgot when my interview was supposed to be scheduled. I got reasonably hard questions."]
[u"A recruiter reached out to me a few months ago asking if I was interested in possibly pursuing an opportunity in working with LinkedIn. Two phone screens after that, all technical and took place over a site like collabedit. The interviewers were nice, and the questions were not too hard; they get everything from a test bank. Was invited for an on-site round after that. During the on-site round, you go through 6 interviews; two based on coding, one on technical communication, one on a project you worked on before, and one on design. Make sure you prepare for the coding section! You don't have freedom to answer the question in any way you wish; you have to go by the function headers they provide for you."]
[u'There were 4 interviews - hiring manager and 3 others on the same team. It was straight forward and to be expected. They asked about the space, what I have done, what I would do to better market the offering. Checking references were key for them.']
[u"The most professional and comfortable interviewing experience I've ever had. I gave my resume to a LinkedIn engineer at my university career fair, and also applied online. A few weeks later, a recruiter called me and discussed what I was looking for in an internship. He then set up my first round technical interview: a single 1-hour phone interview, coding on collabedit. A few days after the first interview, my recruiter scheduled my second round technical interview: two 1-hour phone interviews, same format. The recruiter was very friendly and helpful in giving me advice and insight into the interviews. All three engineers I talked to were patient with me as I worked through the coding problems. If I had to say anything negative about the experience, it would be the length (6 weeks between last interview and offer letter). However, the recruiter was quick to respond to my emails and was willing to take the time to explain exactly what was going on in the process."]
[u'I spoke to the team at the Career Fair at my university. My first round was scheduled two weeks after that, it was about my previous job and the projects I had worked on(Not sure if it counts as a round). The second round was a one hour technical interview with a couple of coding questions.']
[u"Contacted by the company to take place in the recruitment process by Inmail, then had a first call to talk about the job opportunity. A talk with the recruiter managing the vacancy provided more in-depth insight about the job. Then a conversation with the hiring manager took place followed by two task which had to be presented during a conversation with the hiring manager and a person fulfilling the same function. The tasks were a case study of a current client and how this client could improve it's use of Linkedin and a to-list prioritization task. In addition a phone call with the Global Account Manager took place."]
[u"I had a phone screen with the hiring manager (I was reached out to by an internal recruiter). Phone screen was more of an exploratory call - Shared my background in detail / his background in detail / the role in detail. The on site was a two on one interview. One person was logging my answers into the computer - the other was asking questions and taking notes. Overall wasn't difficult."]
[u"Applied through LinkedIn job posting, but didn't hear back initially. A friend who worked there reached out to recruiting a few weeks later, and I heard back immediately after that. The recruiter was extremely courteous and was helpful throughout the process. I had an initial phone interview with the recruiter, then a week later had a phone interview with the hiring manager. Both were easy and behavioral. My next interview was supposed to be in-person at the office, and I informed the hiring manager that I would be out of town the following week on business for my current job at the moment. She told me they'd be glad to work around my schedule. I received an e-mail late Friday afternoon that week saying I was expected to do a Skype interview the following Tuesday. Even though I was going to be out of state and really needed to focus on my job during that week, they required that I prepare a presentation for the interview. I prepared over the weekend, and even during work the following Monday and Tuesday for the presentation/interview. Come time for the interview, the hiring manager called in about 10 minutes late and we had another few minutes of technical issues on their side. Overall, despite my preparations, I didn't feel like I had the proper environment to do well in this interview. The hiring manager also looked extremely bored over the video, and was looking around the room during the entirety of the interview."]
[u'1 phone call with recruiter to discuss the teams. 1 technical phone screen. Another phone call with recruiter, 2 technical interviews with 2 different teams. Got a last phone call from the recruiter that they are unable to move ahead']
[u"2-3 phone screens. Full-day on-site interview. On-site consists of six back-to-back interviews with people in your group and people you'll be working with. Interviews are a mix of behavioral, case, and technical SQL questions. Everyone is very friendly and the interviews were very conversational. People are typically friendly and won't try to trip you up. Very good experience."]
[u'Applied through online system in mid-February, received notification for an interview a couple of weeks later. Would have flown out to MV/Sunnyvale, but I was out-of-country at the time and did a phone interview instead. Received my offer a couple of weeks after that.']
[u"I did a phone screen with a recruiter, then a few days later did a phone screen with the hiring manager. She invited my to an on-site interview at the end of the phone screen. The on-site interview occurred a few days later. I drove up from the Peninsula to their San Francisco office specifically for the on-site interview, which was only 30 minutes. I met with the manager whom I had spoken with on the phone for about 20 minutes, then she excused herself before the slotted time was up to go to a company party. After knowingly asking me to drive 2 hours each way in pouring (potentially dangerous) rain to interview me for only 30 minutes, I felt that this was rude and selfish. LinkedIn then NEVER FOLLOWED UP after my on-site interview. It has now been over a month since the interview. About a week after the interview, I sent an email to my recruiter inquiring about timelines for hearing back (I was interviewing for other positions), and she responded saying the decision would come after the holidays, but I never heard from anyone at the company after that. There was a time when I thought companies not sending a rejection email after you send in a resume was bad.....LinkedIn's rudeness and lack of professionality was on another level entirely."]
[u'Great interview process. Was contacted by LinkedIn Recruiter via LinkedIn of course. Very professional and supportive recruiter. Very knowledgeable about the company and the product line. Set me up with the right people to speak to over the phone. Met a great group of people for the panel interviews across different departments. Felt like they really wanted to make sure the candidate fit in with the culture which I feel is very important. Met people I would be directly work with and for.']
[u"I applied through university. The first round was of coding from hackerrank. 3 question of coding in which two of them were easy. After a month I got a reply from LinkedIn that I have been selected. Then next interviews were scheduled after a month from the date when results were announced. All were telephonic interview. Got call on Skype. Second round was technical and coding they tested my testing skills as well. Third round was also coding and here my knowledge about algorithms were tested. Then fourth round was full of technical question and no coding as we were running out of time. Then I never got a call back from them about the result not even a yes or no. I waited for a month but didn't get a call. They could have shown some courtesy by replying to me with a yes or no. Even the interviewee time is precious. Since I did well so was expecting a call."]
[u"I was reached by a recruiter via LinkedIn. The phone interview was scheduled on the next week. They asked me two technical questions similar to those online questions. Not hard. I was not well prepared so didn't get an offer."]
[u'I was recruited by LinkedIn for this position. During the interview, I met with three individual. Everyone was incredibly nice and welcoming. The interview questions were very basic. The role play document they sent over in preparation was extremely helpful. The enviroment seemed like a positive place to work.']
[u'I was contacted by a LinkedIn recruiter a few months ago (by November, 2014 I think) about a position in Software Engineering area. After the first phone screen (non technical) I was scheduled my first technical phone interview, I decided to take 2 months to get ready and warming up in Algorithms and Data Structures. Finally I finish my first interview very disappointed (with my self) because the interview question was so easy that I could have wrote the solution in less than 15 minutes and I spent almost 45, thanks to my nerves. The interviewer was polite, well explained and called on time, I have no complains about that.']
[u"Initially talked to HR. She asked which all companies I was interviewing with and few other common questions. Then got one technical phone interview through collabedit. Asked about Least common ancestor using parent pointer. They don't even care to reply if you are not selected. Even if you follow up they won't respond."]
[u'I had two phone screen interviews after I spoke with the recruiter for his screen. and then an on site interview with three staff. Questions were more on personal style than technical. They also seemed to want to know if I would fit in and if I would be comfortable in a high growth environment. They wanted things to move quickly because of upcoming holidays.']
[u"The interview took about a month. Two rounds of telephone interviews, both of which are about coding. The first phone interview was ok but the second one was not so pleasant experience in that the interviewers did not seem to care about what my thinking process was. Though I described my thoughts they didn't seem to follow; there were once or twice I talked about an idea but they were not so open to really think of what I said, instead, they gave some hints that are not useful at all, even worse interrupted my thought. I actually saw these problems before on careercup websites but didn't practice them. So was not able to come to the 'correct' solution (well I think that's what they want, because they were not really eager to interact) in 40 minutes."]
[u'Initially contacted by LinkedIn on their site. Very positive about my profile and keen to interview me for a role. Had several phone interviews as it was an international job and then two face to face meetings. The feedback from the phone interviews was extremely positive as was the face to face with quite a senior person. However after it was left that I would have further meetings and travel to their headquarters I heard nothing further despite my efforts to clarify the situation.']
[u'Was contacted by a recruiter through Linked In directly. Had an initial interview guaging my interest in the position. The initial interview answered most of my basic questions, and including a quick short-answer section covering Linux/Unix and TCP networking concepts. The second phone interview was a hands-on scripting interview. I was given a choice of scripting languages, and was expected to write scripts to process various log file examples.']
[u'I had three interviews. The first interview was a screening, he asked simple questions like what do you look for in an internship? What are your goals? What type of person are you? And he gave me two different teams to choose from, "money team" that works on the products that people will pay for. "Consumer team" a team that constantly gets feedback and works to satisfy users and consumers. I had a good interview process but was not offered a position unfortunately. They were heavily focused on error handling (maybe because they are such a big company that errors are thrown to other teams or other members).']
[u'It was a great experience! It was a three round interview. The first round was just a simple phone screening. The second and third round were technical interviews. All interviewers were friendly, welcoming, and the questions were fair but challenging.']
[u'(For a summer internship) I applied through my undergraduate college. Went through a phone screening and a 1-hour phone interview, and then visited the Mountain View campus for three interviews (2 technical) . I got an offer about a week after the on-site interviews. Everyone was really friendly and had lots of good things to say about the internship program!']
[u'3 Phone Interviews - relatively easy coding/data mining questions + 1 full comprehensive full-day onsite interview with 8 different sections - from basic experience and project management to system design, programming puzzles and machine learning questions (including math derivations)']
[u"I was referred to the position by an existing employee. Within a week of my application, the recruiter contacted me to schedule an initial phone screen where we discussed the basics of the role and my previous experiences. A week later, I had a phone interview with the manager of the team where we further discussed my qualifications and reasons for wanting to pursue this position. The conversation was more in depth about research experiences and touched on some technical skills. A technical phone interview was scheduled for a week later where I talked to a senior research associate about specific software experience and ability to learn new skills. The on site interview a week later consisted of 4 meetings with other research associates and the manager. The questions asked were a mix of behavior questions on my previous experiences and technical questions that tested my ability to problem solve. A few days after the on site, the recruiter informed me I ultimately wasn't chosen for the role."]
[u'first they took a online coding test on heckerrank. That was consisting of 3 algorithm question. Two was fairly easy, one was slightly tough. after they come to campus for interview on 1st December. There were 2 rounds of interview. Both was coding on paper. fairly easy, all repeated question from geeksforgeeks.']
[u'Standard engineering interview process: initial call with recruiter, then scheduled for technical phone screen. Had call with two interviewers in the same call which made the communication pretty confusing (think one was just training to become interviewer).']
[u'Submitted resume at university job fair, got a very fast response. First call was with a recruiter, non-technical, discussed resume, general interests, and the like. Next was the phone screen, questions were fairly standard. They will get through as many as they can in an hour, though I personally got stuck on my first and thus only got through two questions.']
[u'I first had a phone interview with a HR recruiter, then a phone interview with the supervisor. Both were very nice. I feel they are looking for a certain personality. It is known to be a very fun atmosphere so try not to by shy and be more bubbley. I felt I met all of the qualifications coming from a previous job that was similar but they are extremely picky with who they hire there.']
[u'It started with the LinkedIn recruiter contacting me for a leadership position. It was followed by a basic technical questionnaire and then two one-hour phone interviews, including a coding exercise. The next stage was onsite interview that included their standard six modules. The interview experience was very great until then. What followed it completely surprised me and I lost all the respect for the company. I was called in for a second onsite interview with the management which went on for over five hours. I did really well and thought I was in. I was totally surprised when they said they found me too "strong" and hence they wouldn\'t hire. The very next day, they promoted their internal candidate to the manager position that I was being interviewed for. That employee was one of the folks who had interviewed me! This is totally unethical! It is a complete shame that the company that prides itself in building the solution for job seekers has no respect for human emotions. I wasted my time obsessing over this company and making thorough preparation for the interview. It broke my heart.']
[u'I hope my experience helps, I had went through the interviews and I also participated in interviewing people at LinkedIn If you are being interviewed by LinkedIn for sales position, the process are generally like this: 1. Recruiter screening - usually being done by phone 2. Meeting: with a senior peer colleague, (probably with recruiter again) 3. Meeting: with hiring manager 4. Panel presentation / interview 5. Meet with a senior leader Sometimes it will be reduced to 3 steps but the experience will be pretty much the same. A few other things LinkedIn is looking at when trying to make a hiring decision, besides skills, experience and capability. Culture fit and passionate about LinkedIn is important, you are expected to learn LinkedIn and its ecosystem before the interview, you suppose to have some understanding on: Talent solution, Sales Solution, Marketing Solution what we call "hire, market & sale"). If an external is too proud and not bothering learning more about this, even qualification may be good, the likelihood of being hired is low. 3 key things you need to demonstrate during the interview: Leadership, leverage, result During peer and manager interviews, important factors to consider is whether you can FIT into the culture and the team members are comfortable working with you. If you are over aggressive sales or too formal making them feel boring, it is unlikely you will get hired. Sometimes hiring decisions are emotional.']
[u'I had 9 interviews, including 3 first round screening interviews and 6 2nd round final interviews. The questions ranged from behavioral to case. Behavioral interviews included questions like where do you want to be in 5 years and what makes you the right person for this job. They seemed to be measuring culture fit, teamwork, experience working globally, project management skills, analytical vs creative tendencies, and operational chops. Case questions were mainly analytical, for example how would you prove the ROI of this product.']
[u'I know the process has changed already, but the process was quite typical: initial recruiter interview, hiring manager and then several rounds with the team and hiring manager again. The focus on questions is on culture fit, career ambitions and future goals. Be sure to "know your story." For the later stages, be prepared to have concise work examples that describe how you work, how you performed etc. They never really drilled down on my examples - but they have to sell the first time round. General tip: be honest and really share what you want to do at LinkedIn or even after LinkedIn. No annoying questions or brainteasers. Overall experience was extremely nice, recruiters guide you through the process, give you tips on the next rounds and so on.']
[u"First had a call with the recruiter who scoped my background and interests and decided for which stream within software engineering was he going to put my application in for. Since I'm more of an interactive, client-side guy, I chose Software engg - Frontend. Had an hour long phone interview with a frontend engineer , who started with general CS and systems questions, went deep into JAVA (Threads, deadlocks, VM, garbage collections) and ended with some challenging javascript questions, which neede knowledge of javascript patterns. About a week later, got a call saying I had made it and they were flying me out to Mountain view for the on-site rounds, 'INvitational'. Chose a convenient date. On their campus, got to know that linkedin holds 'INvitational' for entry-level candidates. It's basically one whole day of interviews and events with their selected set of candidates. The day started off with breakfast, ice-brekers for all the interviewees and an inspirational talk by a senior manager. After warming up, two hour long interviews were scheduled. Both with experienced engineers. One was algorihms - with concept only from standard books like CTCI and the second was web-module development test, where I was shown a certain part of their site and had to write the structure, style it and code the logic. The main thing is to talk through your approach. After the first two rounds was a long tour of campus, lunch and talk with recently joined engineers about their experience. Spent 2 hours here, but helped calm me down. The final 2 rounds came after, one was with a very experienced engineer, who showed me a new UI feature he was implemeting on his work laptop and I had to try and code that up. Stumbled a lot here, mainly because I didn't know about how to implement each feature for all browsers/devices. The last round was a manager interview in which I had to talk about a system design (CTCI - esque) and later about my work experience and work style, probably to determine a culture fit. The day ended by all of us candidates and a few recruters going to a nice sushi place with tons of options. Linkedin surely keeps you well fed."]
[u'I applied online on their career site and was contacted by a recruiter 2 weeks later. Initial phone screen with recruiter - was asked if I currently hold any other offers, the name of the companies who have scheduled interviews with me, my top choice companies, and why I want to work at LinkedIn. It went well. Technical phone interview: 1. Find duplicates in an integer array 2. Given a log file how do you parse the valid ip addresses and make sure there are no duplicates.']
[u"Had first phone call with HR. Went fine. Then There were 1 phone interviews, then told me that I'm out... I was not fully prepared, especially white board coding. So I suggest do more practise for white board coding, bug free."]
[u'Met and talked to a recruiter at a Career Fair. Received an email from the recruiter that they were interested and told to apply to the position online. Was then scheduled for a 60 minute technical phone interview. Invited to on campus final rounds one week later during which I had two technical interviews with engineers, one behavioral interview with a manager, and one system design interview with an app developer engineer.']
[u"All the phone interviewer questions can be found here on glassdoor. The on-site one consists of 5 rounds focusing on soft skills, technical communication, two rounds of coding (one easier, one harder), and system design (level of experience). For me all the coding questions are coming from geeksforgeeks, one is about string matching, the other is set partition. The system design question is about basic information retrieval system, like a search engine prototype. If you are not familiar with this topic, the first chapter of Introduction of information retrieval will cover everything you need to know for the interview. One thing I do want to mention is that, don't spend too much time looking at the prep materials your recruiter sent you, nothing is from there and it's not even pointing you on the right direction. geeksforgeek or leetcode is the way to go. I heard Facebook and Google like leetcode, looks like to me LinkedIn prefer geeksforgeeks a little bit more. Most interviewers are very nice. For me, I had a hard time understanding the Chinese lady in one of the coding round due to her strong Chinese accent. Another interviewer told me he is pulled into this interview and he didn't prepare at all. It showed up as I realized he himself did not really know the answer of the question he was asking. We were kinda just trying to figure out a solution together during the interview, not sure if this is the way it is supposed to be. The system design round is a disaster for me because I don't have any background of information retrieval system. I think it's funny because after the interview I spent like 2 hours reading the first chapter of Introduction of Information Retrieval and that's all they were asking for. I just don't see how this is a good indication of my level of experience. Also, the interviewer in this round is very inexperienced in terms of explaining the question, clarifying confusions and having a respective attitude. Although the recruiter did point out the interviewers may not be the people i will be working with if I get an offer and join them, I do want to say I found half of the interviewers not that type of people I would like to work with. Besides the interview, I don't really like their work environment very much. Although the office looks nice, both the cafeteria and gym are very disappointing. They offer free food, but they put tons of oil into everything probably trying to make you feel full longer so you don't eat too much. There is not many healthy choices either, and the cafeteria is very small, crowded and noisy. The onsite gym is practically a workout room, not a real gym at all, like those workout rooms that come with your apartments complex. Not sure if you care about this, but most people working there don't seem to have a general sense of how clothes fit together to look acceptable. Another thing I noticed is there is a huge Asian population, which implies if you have low tolerance on accent you may have hard time communicating. Just something nontechnical to think about. Also, their office is kinda hidden inside of Google campus, so the traffic there is really bad. There are lots of bumpers around that area so driving won't be fun either."]
[u'I applied for the job online and received a call from a recruiter within few days, she scheduled for a phone interview with a recruiter to talk about basic stuff and then after a day scheduled for the next step which was a technical phone screen. Very smooth and fair question that you should know top of your head. After 1 or 2 days another call to schedule for onsite and took about 5 hours to chat with different people from general web developers to the director. I enjoyed the whole process one-on-one interviews very fair questions and nice interviewers. But It took a week to get the offer after my onsite interview which was a long time without any communication at all and negotiation process was very good but tough :) The best part was the onsite interview process and negotiation part and the worst part was the coordination in scheduling, flight ticket and expense report.']
[u"I had a very positive experience at LinkedIn, although I didn't get an offer. I got in touch with the recruiter via a referral. The recruiter, the hiring manager and the other persons from the team, were all very nice. In the end I didn't get an offer since they choose to promote someone from within the company. Which was too bad for me at the time but promoting people form within the company is actually good for current employees and speaks for the company."]
[u"Was pretty disorganized. Got a phone call at the time of the interview from the recruiter saying that my interviewers were in a training session. I ended up having my interviewer half an hour later from an Indian guy that I could not understand. I had to ask him to repeat his questions every time, multiple times. The questions were all frontend technical questions of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, but I didn't study enough and didn't do very well."]
[u"I have applied online and the recruiter came back to me very quickly. The phone interview went well (see the first question) and I was invited for the on-site interview. The process itself and the welcome I received was top notch (you get your LinkedIn connections map printed as a gift, lunch is included as a part of the interview and your schedule is presented to you on an iPad [which you have to give up at the end] with LinkedIn profiles of all your interviewers). The coding questions were pretty general with some more difficult variations (see second question as an example) However one interviewer tried to convince me that you can put any number on the Fibonacci sequence (which you can't btw) and I have the feeling that conversation cost me the job, since she was extremely bullish on her being right."]
[u'An internal recruiter contacted me through LinkedIn. There was an initial 30min phone call to talk about background and get the gist of how they\'re setup and the rest of the process. Then was a longer call with a senior developer to talk "shop". Next was a set of technical phone calls/collaborative coding sessions to test basic JavaScript and HTML/CSS skills, nothing too difficult, about 45min each. All of this took place within about 10 business days. They flew me out for an on-site interview (full day 10am-3pm; a series of back-to-back 1-hour technical interviews with devs, mostly white boarding code and logic, with a lunch conversation with the development manager and the day ending with a conversation with their CTO).']
[u"Got a call from recruiter based on my LinkedIn profile details. Recruiter scheduled a Skype/Phone technical interview on working day that to an odd timing (Noonish) . On Interview day (~30mins before) I got call from the recruiter about the scheduled interview cancellation and the reason told to me that Interviewer has declined the calendar invite. They never bothered about the Candidate's schedules and calendars. The recruiters were so lazy to call back on rescheduling the interview details, for them it took a day long. I lost my day because of such slippage from their end. Recruiters never thinks candidate's time also precious like interviewer's time."]
[u'Had a couple phone screens and then two onsite interviews. I was able to meet a bunch of people and ask them questions too, which helped me with my decision. Great experience throughout.']
[u'Phone interview with recruiter, which was on the lengthy side for a screener, followed by an in-person with the hiring manager, during which I was asked to conduct a sales presentation.']
[u'The position was actually for "Business Analytics Associate", but I can\'t find that in the job titles. The interview process involved 2 phone interviews and an on-site. The first phone interview was with the hiring manager. I had a deep conversation with him about career paths in general and we really clicked (and even went over by about 20 minutes). The bulk of the interview was answering 5 SQL questions over Google docs, that increased in intensity. I was able to answer all 5, but I remember the last 3 were seriously difficult and required a lot of data expertise and brainstorming. I had to put down the phone and brainstorm for a few minutes before answering the last one. However, I was able to answer all of them successfully, and I impressed the manager. The second interview was just over phone. They were very interested in having me on-site. On-site was about 6.5 hours long with 9 people, including a lunch interview. The process was EXTREMELY stressful, the most difficult interview I\'ve had yet. They really grill you with on-the-fly questions that can variate from behavioral, case, and writing SQL and math functions on the board. The hiring manager finally came in about 4th place or so and brought a nice printed network model of my LinkedIn connections. It was a really nice surprise, and at first I thought it was just a neat gift, but turned out it was part of the interview. The essential question was "how would you build this?" I had little knowledge of it, but gave it my best and I think I still managed to impress him. The lunch interview was not very lenient. I remember being extremely hungry and all I wanted was to take a breather, but during lunch the interviewer kept firing question-after-question, doing most of the hearing and forcing me to talk while I tried my best to down as much food as possible. I could have choked. They should really take it easy. Either way - a very valuable experience. Most of the interviewers were very nice, but their questions were not easy. I was very confident I would get an offer, but unfortunately did not receive a call for a week. After almost 2 weeks the recruiter called me and said unfortunately they will not be proceeding. The only feedback was "my business knowledge was low". I have no idea what they meant by that because most of the questions were either technical or behavioral. I was quite heartbroken because I gave it my all, but at the least it helped me really develop my interview skills so I can apply them later.']
[u'The recruiter I worked with was very helpful and friendly. Everything went smoothly until the actual phone interview. The phone interview went terrible. First, they called me 5 minutes late. They did not introduce themselves (only their names) but did not tell me what they did. Jumped straight into the questions. Started off with the "Tell me about yourself" textbook question which is always a turnoff. You have my resume, why aren\'t you prepared? Gave me a vague troubleshooting question, which I respect because I think they were trying to get at my troubleshooting steps as a QA. So when I asked questions about what I\'m allowed to do vs what I wasn\'t, i.e. "Do I get access to the code or is it black box testing?" they told me "Yes you get access and this is black box." So I tried to answer with both, but I could not tell over the phone whether they were liking the answers or if I should have been steered in another direction. They then asked me a programming question and only gave me about half an hour on it. In the half hour I was asked to create a Stack with two caveats: there is a "getMiddle" method that returns the middle element of the stack and it must be of O(1) access time. Naturally any O(1) access time would be an array, so I used that, although ideally I would use something like an ArrayList in Java. Which brings me to my next point: When I asked "In Java there is a collection called ArrayList. Can I just use an ArrayList? I feel like that would be cheating because it seems like it would defeat the whole purpose of the question." and they told me they weren\'t experts in Java, despite the fact I told the recruiter I would be most comfortable in Java. If I am going to take a programming test with someone, they better at least understand Java. Poorly planned. Anyway I am explaining my algorithm and I can tell in their voices they are getting a little impatient, maybe because time was running out, or maybe because I am not getting the answer they were looking for. Twice I had to whiteboard my algorithm step by step and they could not understand it, i.e. "Increment counter, go to array[counter], push() the element on", etc. It was a poor use of my time. It really sounded like they didn\'t want me to do something in particular but since we were short on time I think they just called it quits. Finally I did not get much time to ask about the culture because we started late. I asked what they enjoyed most about LinkedIn and what they could change about it, and one of them told me the good: "work with brilliant people and the space is open so it is very collaborative." What they would change: "I want to learn from the brilliant people" so it sounded very contradicting. If the culture is so collaborative, what is stopping you from learning? Did the interviewer just give me part of her career plan? If so, does that mean my career plan will also have an obstacle "There are brilliant people here but I can\'t learn from them unless I put myself forward"? Is that really the culture I want to work in? And since we started late, another group of people were waiting for the room so you can tell they were in a huge hurry to get out. As an interviewee it never feels okay to be rushed "out of an interview." After the interview, the recruiter emailed me a rejection saying they wanted someone "more technical." While my solution may have not been the prettiest, it got the main O(1) job done, and I don\'t know what else could have been detrimental to my technical skills. Overall what I got from the interview: 1) they are unorganized 2) not as open as they claim they are 3) a sense of stubbornness What I didn\'t get from the interview: 1) My job role 2) Their job roles 3) Their day-to-day lives 4) any sense of culture other than the negatives I mentioned above 5) what a great company they are 6) any feedback about my technical skills. I\'ve gone through multiple interviews and the recruiters have always called me to tell me where I had fallen short and always encouraged me to brush up those areas and try again.']
[u"Contacted through Linkedin via recruiter. Phone interview with 2 engineers. Called onsite. 4 one to one interview after 2 weeks. Simple questions based on scripting and OOPs. Basic networking questions. After 3 days, they sent me rejection saying my programming was not to mark. They didn't ask me any difficult programming questions. 2 questions were given which I solved impromptu and they were absolutely correct. I don't know what they were looking for as 2 interviewers asked me to ask them questions for almost an 1 hour (both combined)"]
[u'phone screen with hr\uff0c pretty standard. Feedback from hiring manager that they want a more experienced candidate. Must be able to write Python and have lots experience in machine learning']
[u'Applied online got an email to schedule the interview. The interview went very smooth and most questions were what could be expected of a phoneinterview. There were some company specific questions Leadership, people skills, etc. Got scheduled for the next step on the phone. Very smooth, professional and good experience.']
[u"I applied through my school's career fair. It was a total of 2 phone interviews and an onsite which I didn't make. The first phone interviewer was nice and helped me with the problems. The second one was a bit moody and I was confused by one question."]
[u'Initially, recruiter was bang-on about my CV, stating I had EXACTLY what he was searching in a candidate - language, skills, experience, availability. Stated he\'d contact me to provide insight on the department head\'s interview style. No communication from the interviewer despite two e-mails and a follow-up call. Bombed the interview. Utterly. Interviewer had a hard on for what a person knew about the ins/outs of the business, not about what experience the candidate could bring to the team. I learned specific info about the department over a week-end. The interviewer stated to me, "I can hear that you\'re reading something, you know nothing about us!" In fact, I was merely presenting my discoveries (sans notes, from memory). Interviewer stated I should consider a lesser job with LinkedIn. Contacted the interviewer for feedback, no response. Three months later, their position remains open. Unfilled. Still on their LinkedIn jobs board. No wonder.']
[u'Recruiter reached out on LinkedIn. First round was the phone screen from the recruiter. Second round was a manager level member of the team. Final round of interviews were with 4 individuals. Interviews were a combination of behavioral and case. I never felt grilled, and the cases were not difficult (mostly thinking through a real world business problem that the team faced/is facing). As long as you have a firm understanding of the business model, key issues, growth strategies, etc., you should be fine.']
[u'Telephonic interviews, skype interviews & then onsite interviews at their office. Everything technical, Operating systems, Web architecture, Database Systems. Security protocols, TCP (Transmission control protocol), UDP ( User datagram Protocol ), ICMP ( Echo reply ) etc.']
[u'Recently I have been interviewed with this company. I had high expectations but it seems interviewer was a fresher, on the first phone interview he started to ask theoretical questions like definitions of some term as I am fresh college graduate. I was astonished and got confused though I answered the data structures problems but I was sure I m not gonna go further with this company. I think they need to give some kind of training to their interviewer. And they should keep their ego on their desk before coming for interview. He may b amazing engineer but anytime any one can screw no matter how much good you are.']
[u'First round was behavioral and they just asked about how I got into CS and other standard questions about my interests. Second round was an hour long technical interview. Third round was two-one hour long interviews. And fourth was just talking with the team.']
[u'Phone interview: Two Algorithm questions, which could be found on this site. And some HTML/CSS/JS questions. Not so difficult by probably need perfect response. The recruiter failed to schedule my interview twice and then left the position. It took me two months to get first round interview.']
[u'I submitted my resume to a job board, and was set up with an interview through a recruiter. The phone screen was set up within the first week. After the phone screen, an in-person interview was set up in the SF office for the following week. The in-person interview was 3 rounds. First was Q&A and coding, then test strategy, then a final round of coding and testing. The interviewers were mostly friendly, except for one person who was completely disinterested from the start, as though they had somewhere else to be.']
[u"Was contacted by a recruiter through LinkedIn (very meta) and given two weeks preparation. The interviewer I was scheduled with wasn't the one who ended up interviewing me, and instead it was someone who had a very tough time speaking English and explaining the problems. I solved both questions, but it took a long time before I would understand what he meant when trying to explain them. This chewed up a substantial chunk of the interview time (for example, it took ~5-10 minutes to even get to the collaborative online editor because I couldn't understand the letters he was pronouncing in the URL)."]
[u'output all the permutations and compute the code time complexity if your code is good enough, the time complexity should be n! but when i was interviewing with the two interviewers, i wrote a n^n solution. actually, there are recursive and iterative solutions in n! time complexity. The best solution should call next permutation function n! times.']
[u'Got a first round phone interview. it is a HR and a few general questions like: why do you choose LinkedIn? why do you want to be a software engineer? what is your expectation from our company? what kind of working environment do you want?']
[u"LinkedIn organized a recruitment process in our campus recently. There was an online test of duration 90 minutes with around 30 multiple choice questions and 3 coding questions. Multiple Choice questions included questions from Data structures, DBMS, OS and Computer Networks. The 3 coding questions were of easy level. I was able to solve only 2 of them, still I cleared the written round. Next round was skype interview. He asked field of my interest and then started with it. First we started with operating system - questions about paging, swapping, what is virtual memory etc. Then Computer Networks - What is difference between tcp/udp, which one is used in live streaming and paid subscriptions. How connection is established between nodes etc. In Java, he asked me the internal working of garbage collector and finally how B-Tree works internally and need of threading. All the topics discussed were of my choice and interviewer frankly asked if i was uncomfortable with any of them. He drilled down each question to the finest level, which at times confused me and i had to change my answers. I was not prepared about what will be asked during interview so the whole session was awful for me. This interview was to be followed by final onsite interview in Bangalore but i since i couldn't clear this round, i never got a call."]
[u"One of the coolest interview experience. Had a standard phone screen, followed by a round of on-site interviews. On-site interviews were really focused, which you don't see much often, and all the interviewers were top-notch people. Really enjoyed the process, which was a big plus for me when considering the offer."]
[u'Had 4 interviews over the phone, including 1 via Skype. 3 normal phone interviews and a presentation on the platform and their products based on a case study. These were with a number of different levels of seniority within the organisation. All were very friendly and very positive throughout the process. Overall a pleasant experience even if I did not receive an offer at the end.']
[u'Got contacted by a recruiter via linkedin. Did an initial phone interview on ml concepts and coding and according to the recruiter it went so well that they did not need me to do another one. Got invited to the campus for an onsite which I can name more a torture than an interview; staring from about 9:30 am lasting until 5pm. 7 interviews in a day!!!!! Unstructured interview; I was doing the interview for a data science/software engineering position; open ended questions; some interviewers were more after math/theory and some high level software design and some not sure! It was hard to figure who is looking for what and how to form a proper answer. One of the interviewers was a little rude even though he was 15-20 mins late for the interview. Generally not a good experience. The campus and food were great though. Got a call from recruiter a few days later. "Your interview went well but we couldn\'t find any position for you. I tried to find a team by passing your resume over but unfortunately we don\'t have an open position at the time"! A simple question for them: Why the hell do you interview people then? Why the hell do you waste people\'s times by sending bunch of bol... job opening messages over and over? Interesting that after I did the onsite and was waiting for the feedback, there was another linkedIn recruiter contacting me about open engineering position at linkedin!!!!']
[u"Had first phone call with HR. Went fine. Then There were 2 phone interviews. Both of them asked traditional questions. The second technical round interviewer was very rude. Did not introduce himself. He got into the coding test directly. He asked 2 questions which I answered in 30 minutes out of the one hour interview. He had no better thing to do so he asked me trace the whole recursive code on phone. I don't know how these people judge someone's skills.. Their questions are either from leetcode or some fixed set of pool. I got a reject the next day even after answering their questions well in time."]
[u"The hiring and interview process was very long and tedious. As a recent college graduate, I expected to jump through some hoops during the interview process, but not like this. It always seemed like I was constantly being handed off. It started with an internal referral. A month after the referral, I received an email from a recruiter in their New York office to schedule a phone screen. I thought this was strange since I was applying for the Mountain View, CA office, but we scheduled a time and date. When the time arrived, I got an email a half hour after our schedule phone screen, to reschedule. This should of been a red flag, but I moved on with the process. Two weeks after the phone screen, I was informed that I was selected for a on-site interview and I would hear from a recruiter in Mountain View about a time and date to come in. It took over 6 weeks to hear from the recruiter in Mountain View. And they wanted me to come in the next week for an on-site after 6 weeks of no contact. The actual on-site interview was well organized and professionally run, great experience. But the worst part of it all was the suspense after the on-site interview. The recruiter told the group that we would hear back, regarding an offer, in around two days or by latest the end of the week (by the New York recruiter). With their current track record, I should have expected this. Never heard anything by the end of the week. I emailed and called the recruiter in New York but did not hear back till the following week. Overall LinkedIn's interview process was not well organized and there was a lot of lag between recruiters."]
[u'The Interviewer ask the running up staircase with n steps quesion which need to get how many possible ways to run up the stairs. Each time you can hop either 1 step, 2 steps or 3 steps at a time. In addition, he asks some question about my research such as graph algorithms.']
[u'A recruiter looked at my LinkedIn profile and contacted me there. Got first phone interview setup with two interviewers. Interview was setup for a week after. - Started with asking about my present job. Team details and work specifications. - Went to collabedit.com for technical questions. Q1: Given a string, return true if it is a number else return false. (Pretty straightforward) Q2: What is a singleton class and how would you design it. Some threading related things for it. Q3: Write a parseInt function (Similar to Q1). I answered all the questions nicely. No objections. Since I looked referred glassdoor for practice, I was familiar with all these questions. How can I get them wrong ?!?! But still got a REJECTION. No reasoning given. They told, they find me a potential candidate but cannot go ahead for now.']
[u'I was referred by a friend, then had a phone screening by a recruiter, followed by a phone interview with an enterprise team supervisor. Both phone interviews were standard, questions were focused on my background and customer service experience. I was asked in for an in-person group interview (three candidates, three interviewers) - the six of us met for a half hour, each interviewer took turns asking basic questions about background, what do you like about working in customer service, etc., then we each had two 30 minute individual interviews. All three interviewers were incredible nice and welcoming, and seemed mostly focused on finding someone who would be a good fit for the team and the LinkedIn culture. My advice is do your homework, know about the LinkedIn recruiter product, read some articles published by current employees about their experience, and do as many informational interviews as possible. Most of the questions asked called for specific examples ("Discuss an instance that you dealt with an angry customer, and how you dealt with the situation"). Overall, I had a great experience, and can\'t wait to get started!']
[u'1 round phone interview and answered two questions, one is to print tree level by level, the other is check if a string is a valid number including dot. Onsite interviews with 5 rounds in total, 2 rounds with coding, 1 round with design, 1 round with projects, 1 round with culture']
[u'Interview Process was very smooth - Took about 5 weeks. Had two initial phone interviews. These rounds were purely programming rounds. Got notified of the results the same day itself. Onsite interview consisted of 6 rounds. 2-programs, 1- design, 1- lunch, 1-manager. Interview process was very smooth and organized and all the interviewers made sure that I felt comfortable with the process. I would suggest practicing lot of programming questions, look into LinkedIn opensource projects, read a lot about Distributed Systems.']
[u"They claimed in the listing of wanting someone with experience getting insight from data using SQL and Excel while presenting results in PowerPoint; however, with 4+ years of doing just that I'm given the unqualified moniker. Unless you have an inside track or until HR writes what they actually want in their postings, I would not recommend trying their application process."]
[u'I was contacted by a recruiter through email and set up a phone interview. The technical portion was done through collabedit. They asked two coding problems. They also asked to describe a project I had worked on before. I had a second phone interview that was similar to the first. The interviewer was hard to understand. Again had two coding problems, both were fair.']
[u'Applied online, got the phone screen with HR. They asked basic questions about your career and what you have done so far. Then got the 1st phone interview which was very simple and easy coding question. The 2nd phone interview was much harder and requires a thorough amount of studying. Be prepared! HR was very nice and responsive.']
[u"The recruiter contacted me through email and arranged me a technical phone interview. I'm a little disappointed though, the interview was scheduled at 6:00PM Eastern Time. During the phone interview(using collabedit.com), the interviewer asked two coding questions: (1) the deepest common ancestor of two nodes of a tree (2) all permutations of a string. The questions were reasonable, but I failed to solve the second one. Also the interviewer thought I'm not engaging enough(didn't talk much)."]
[u"A recruiter initially reached out to me through LinkedIn. After a few phone call interviews, I moved on to a few remote skills exercises. I didn't interview for a specific position, instead I was told that the position the company thinks you are best suited for is determined through your interview process (whether you're senior or staff level or whatever). I had two screen-sharing interviews, which were coding exercises where two developers from LinkedIn would give you specific challenges or examples and ask you to solve them / work through them. Each one was about 45 minutes, with 30 minutes of coding and 15 minutes of just questions or introductions or whatnot. The first covered JavaScript, while the second covered HTML and CSS. Even though you're coding in a web interface, the code doesn't compile or actually show UI. I think it's so that you don't get distracted with minutia of making something actually work and instead talk about strategy and overall steps to achieving your goal. After these first skill assessment interviews, I was flown out to Mountain View to interview at their campus. The on-campus interview was pretty much a full day process. I started off with a brief tour of the office and some discussion about the background of the company with one of the people I had exchanged emails with during the early phases of the process. Then I was taken to a meeting room where the rest of my interviews would take place. There were six or seven groups of interviews. The first two were general information about the company and about the team. Then there were 4 technical interviews, each one with a pair of developers (one senior, one junior). Each one addressed different aspects of development - CSS, HTML, JS, etc. There was also a lunch interview, which is when you just grab lunch with another developer. Each of these interviews is about the same format as the phone interviews - about 45 minutes each with 30 minutes or so of coding and 15 minutes or so of general questions. Also, the technical challenges are all done on a whiteboard, without a computer."]
[u'I was contacted by a recruiter on LinkedIn, who later called me and informally discussed the position they were looking for and asked about my background. After this phone call, the recruiter scheduled a phone interview with the hiring manager based on my availability, which happened to be about 3 weeks after this initial phone call from the recruiter. First, the interviewer discussed the group and role of the position. He asked about my background and experience working on projects. At the end of the phone interview he said that I should expect a call from the recruiter about scheduling a face to face interview. About 3 weeks after the phone interview I was contacted by email about scheduling a face to face interview. The face to face interview was scheduled and then the day before the interviews the recruiter emailed to cancel stating the reason being "re-purposing headcount".']

[u"The call came literally a day after I had submitted my CV for consideration and a very quick screening interview on the phone confirming my CV and people I already knew working within the business. I was asked to take a phone interview a few days later which was strange as my current office was around the corner however this was news to the recruiter. I will add the recruiter was extremely nice and friendly and came across very happy and upbeat. The phone interview went on for an hour and 10 min as we were both very chatty and at one stage the recruiter asked to speed things up around the 40 min mark. At the end of the interview he asked did I have any questions and then confirmed the next step would be to come in to the office and meet different managers and I would get a call on Friday. That call never came and instead I received a call the following Wednesday saying I was unsuccessful in my application as my answers were not detailed enough. Looking back the phone interview felt rushed and the questions could have been more specific as in this is exactly what I'm looking for as during the interview I did give a lot of examples of what I was looking for"]

[u'Contacted someone in my network and was able to get an interview. My contact reached out to the global supervisor who in turn referred me to the hiring manager. Had to reach out a few times to the hiring manager before I was able to obtain an interview appointment.

[u'Applied for the position through their website. Received an email from one of their recruiters. The recruiter seemed really friendly and provided some background into the position. Went through some standard questions regarding my background and said she would pass my info to the hiring manager to schedule another phone screen. Maybe I misunderstood the recruiter but it felt like they would followup with me to schedule next interview but I never heard from them. I sent the recruiter an email to the recruiter a couple of weeks later following up on status. She said she would check with hiring manager and get back to me. Never heard anything since and never received a rejection email. As such, not a good experience.']
[u'I applied through a friend, the recruiters were very helpful and quick to respond at the beginning. I was told I would go straight to a call with the hiring manager but I heard nothing back.

[u'I was contacted by a recruiter on LinkedIn, who later called me and informally discussed the position they were looking for and asked about my background. After this phone call, the recruiter scheduled an hour-long technical phone interview with two software engineers based on my availability, which happened to be 2 weeks after this initial phone call from the recruiter. The technical phone screen was conducted using collabedit. First, the interviewer asked about my background and what my favorite project was that I had worked on. Then, the technical questions began. He said, depending on the time, that 2 coding questions would be asked and we had enough time for both questions plus extra time for me to ask them questions. I coded my answers in C++. I was notified 3 days after the phone screen that they would not be moving forward with me.']
[u'Contacted Via LinkedIn, there was some scheduling issues, so process took 4 weeks. 2 people took my interview, senior and junior. Senior interviewer was late for the interview and joined in for last 15 mins of the interview. Junior developer was in the company for little over 2 months. So that was little weird, as junior person was not very articulate. LinkedIn profile that they send were different then the people who actually conducted the interview. There was no actual contact with HR apart from email exchanges, basically they treat candidates as assembly line.']
[u"I applied through the LinkedIn website and was contacted by a recruiter to set up an interview. The interview itself was very friendly and laid back. The recruiter told me about the different positions available within the data science department, and how the entire department was structured.

On-site presentation (you have one week to prepare with information that's given to you) with a diverse mixture of managers and analysts. Mostly questions related to the presentation, some scenario questions, and then some final behavioral questions. Overall, the process took about a month (one interview per week, mostly). The whole process was very fair and they really want you to feel comfortable and succeed. Just prepare, do your best, and be yourself. Also make sure you give good references!

[u"I was contacted by a recruiter on the linkedin platform, due to my experience in network stacks. I had a phone screen, two technical phone interviews (coding on collabit), followed by an on-site interview.

It wasn't a terrible experience, but I would not consider going through the process again without first exhausting the 1st tier options out there."]

[u"I wasn't actively looking for a summer internship because I was working on a startup, but I got an email on LinkedIn from a recruiter and did a 30-minute interview by phone. Really nice recruiter and the position was enticing, but I wasn't really considering giving up on my venture."]
[u'The initial communications were through a recruiter that works for LinkedIn. They contacted me about the job offer and we moved on to interviews. I interviewed with an engineer who did a very high-level asking of questions related to web architecture and how I would go about scaling X or Y. It was not very technical, although you were encouraged to speak your mind about technical topics. Based on the feedback received by that interview we moved on the another phone interview that was a programming interview. You were allowed to pick a language (I picked python) and they asked you 4 questions. Each question built on the other questions and it was a timed interview (60 minutes). The questions you were asked were taken straight out of CS 101 text books; given input, if input is divisible by 2 do X, if divisible by 6 do Y, if divisible by both do Z, else print something. Interestingly, because I haven\'t done any of these "simple" coding problems for upwards of 10 years, I found this portion of the interview the most difficult. For me it was difficult because these questions just are not what you come across in the real world. The majority of the code things I do today involve fixing bugs here and there and monkey patching code to make it work. Also, you typically have some context and foresight into a problem before you start coding. Being dropped a simple 1 + 2 question is nothing you\'d ever encounter working in the real world; it\'s all academic as far as I\'m concerned. I felt like I failed the programming interview, but surprisingly, I got a call back saying they wanted to do an on-site interview. They flew me out to Mountain View and I spent a full day with a number of their engineers going through what they called "modules". This is where it got interesting. I took special care to look at their culture. I noticed that the building is very quiet, there is not a lot of personal "schwag" hanging around people\'s areas. Not a lot of smiling engineers...curious. The modules included you having semi-technical one-on-one interviews with an engineer. There were some engineers that were VERY technical and weren\'t much interested in the chitchat that can happen where you talk about what you might currently be working on. The easiest module was the "lunch" module where you ...well...ate lunch, haha. I was expecting this to be a group thing though and instead it was just a you + 1 engineer who ate at the cafeteria. The engineer was the only one that I really "liked" after meeting them all, but still it was a one-to-one interaction. I was really hoping for a group effort. Throughout the WHOLE on-site interview process I got the sinking feeling that individuality trumps groups at LinkedIn. This bums me out because I currently operate in a fairly strong group position and if I am moving to a new position where I am more isolated, I really don\'t want that. Also, its so quiet. Creepy quiet. Like none of the engineers talk to each other. My current position there is ALWAYS something going on and a lot more background noise to remind you that "you\'re around people". I didn\'t get that feeling from LinkedIn. After the interview I just went back and cooled off in the hotel before my flight left the next day. Because of the 2 hour time difference, it was a good idea to plan for staying 3-ish days; 1 to get there, 1 to interview and 1 to leave.']
[u"Got contact from linkedin. One phone interview. I am more backend developer, but they are expect more frontend developer. So field doesn't match. didn't go further. Two interviewers, they were asking all general js and css, html question. Nothing too hard, some of questions are out of my knowledge. Recruiter called me to give me feedbacks, this is every nice."]
[u'First I went through a phone interview where they ask me the most basic questions, like what am I working on, what is my strength, ect. Second interview was a more technical phone interview where they ask me to write some class definition online using any programming language I prefer.']
[u'3 rounds of interview - all telephonic, questions started from the basics of Linux, networking and bash scripting. First round was based on linux and networking, second on scripting and third one was taken by the hiring manager, which was most on why Linkedin and some very basic linux/networking questions.']
[u"The HR coordinators at LinkedIn are absolutely terrible at their job. I applied to the California LinkedIn office and heard back within two weeks from Recruiter #1, based out of New York, asking to come into the office. That just happened to be the same week I was traveling, so I told her I could come into the office the following week. A different recruiter, Recruiter #2, also based out of New York, responded that I could do a Skype interview, so I gave her my available times. Three days pass, and no response. They she finally emails me asking me to give her times, as if it was my fault that she can't manage her email. I gave her times again. Four days later, Recruiter #1 schedules me for an on-site interview because she had delayed the process so long that I was done with my trip. She sends me an address and time, and a couple of days later I go to the office for the interview. Turns out, she gave me the wrong address. They were expecting me at the Mountain View office, but the recruiter gave me the office for the San Francisco office. I end up having the interviews via Skype, but between offices. The interviews were perfectly nice. Asked behavioral questions and about my interest in advertising operations. Nothing too difficult. Following the interview, I sent thank you emails, which received no response. Two weeks later, Recruiter #1 tells me that I will have a response in that week. I never hear from them again. I don't understand why they needed recruiters from New York to schedule a California interview, and they needed two to schedule a time, but clearly it led to miscommunication and disorganization everywhere. For a company as well-known and established as LinkedIn, it is an embarrassment that their HR and Recruitment process is such a terrible mess."]

[u'Initially contacted by a Linked in recruiter - basic behavioral questions. He did not seem to know a few key things about the position, which I later got from the technical interviewer. Technical interview focused mainly on system, network admin / operations type of questions. Not what I was expecting based on the job description, so probably not what I was looking for anyway.']
[u'Hiring process included a telephonic call, and onsite interview with 10 folks. two folks were assigned for every interview (that is 5 interviews). They were piloting an initiative of a junior developer paired with a senior developer, and finally with hiring manager.

[u'I was contacted on LinkedIn by a recruiter. We scheduled a time to talk on the phone. During the phone conversation, he explained what the process was going to be like, and we scheduled the first phone interview. I had a total of two phone interviews. Both of them were conducted by two engineers and involved problem solving and questions. I was then scheduled for an in-house interview. The in-house interview consisted of 5 interviews: all except for one were conducted by two engineers. Two covered coding, one covered system design, one covered team work (which was also a design question) and the last covered engineering communication.']

[u"The recruiter was very competent, unfortunately, can't say the same about the senior manager that interviewed. The manager deliberately asked questions that cannot be answered correctly, instead of to-the-point questions that can be answered."]
[u'Initial phone screen followed by phone interview by hiring manager. Pretty basic behavioral questions. Presentation- panel method - which they prepare you for very well and the experience was pretty painless. Questions are not too tough, so its all about how in depth you go on the answers.

[u"1. The hiring manager called, asked a few questions about my skills and told me she will get back to me about coming in for interview. 2. Hiring manager sent me an email with an easy homework assignment about a campaign email and a website page. 3. Created a presentation, went in for an interview. Met with 2 people separately from different departments, 30 minutes each, and the last interview was with the hiring manager and one of her associates. Everyone seemed great and interested except for the hiring manager. She was very dry and had no sense of humor. 4. Found out this position had been posted on and off since November of 2013 and I applied in May and interviewed in June 2014. The hiring manager's personality did not really fit in with the rest of the LinkedIn folks who were very friendly and outgoing. Even if I had got an offer I would have most likely declined because I did not get a good vibe from the hiring manager when I met met her during the interview. She did not smile even once. Bad day, maybe?"]
[u"I applied online, and was later referred by a friend who had gotten an internship offer earlier in the academic year. I first had a phone screen with the recruiter, who then matched me with a team that was tailored to my interests/skills/experiences. I then had a 1-hour technical phone interview with one of the staff software engineers on the team, and was notified of the feedback that night. I was then scheduled for a second technical phone interview that would occur a few days later, which ended up being much more difficult than the first. I then had a third interview, which was mostly informational, with the engineering manager of the team. I got to ask questions about the types of projects the team worked on, the types of projects planned for interns, and the overall environment and culture. Overall, the entire process was very transparent and organized: you know who you are interviewing with (given a link to the interviewer's LinkedIn profile before each interview), and the recruiter was available to answer questions at any point in the process. They were also able to expedite the process for me since I had other competing offers."]
[u'Applied online, got call from Recuiter and the process was very professional and quick. The hiring manager and HR and Recruiter worked well to accommodate any time restrictions i had. Had initial phone screen with one of the engineers. Used collabedit for the interview/tech phone screen. Questions asked were fairly simple. Check if a String contains a number or not. Other was a backtracking/recursion basic CS question. Also some basic Java questions.']
[u'long process and kept getting extended. Very anxious process for me! I wish it could be shorter or have more reliable time frames of when to expect a final answer']
[u'LinkedIn business practices and lack of accountability are very disappointing, especially given their position in the market place. I have to agree with the glass door stats that 27% of applicants felt the interview process was negative. I was contacted by internal Recruiter about "exciting" opportunity with LinkedIn, he liked my profile and would like to connect to discuss the opportunity. I agreed to take the call as an informational interview with a notion to learn more about the job. For some reason, it did not happen and instead I was asked questions about my current role at the company and why would I be a good fit for a LinkedIn. Finally, I had to explain the recruiter, that I am not sure what the position is and I am a bit blindsided by his questions. It was very awkward for me, considering the fact that it was not disclosed in the email that it will be an actual phone interview. At the end of the conversation, he again assured me about my great professional experience and a background with the next step to set up a call with a hiring manager. Despite all of that and how unprofessional he was, I sent him a thank you note asking for an actual job description. Never heard back a word or at least "no" thank you. I am absolutely appalled by this type of business practices and lack of business ethics. If LinkedIn cannot get it together, who can? Have we forgotten how to be courteous and respectful?']
[u'Too lengthy - they want to hire the best of the best, its a joke they only look at certain profiles they want people from Google! You can have great experience but if you lack top school or google background you will not be considered.']
[u"Contacted via linkedin, talked for a bit about what i've done and setup a phone interview. Interview was over the phone with two other interviewers. The question was about returning n closest points on a plane. Interviewers were hard to understand and hung up on minor code related details about the code instead of the general concepts."]
[u'I was contacted by LinkedIn through a former coworker as an internal referral. I liked the job description and admired the Company. Timing for a change was right. Location (Sunnyvale) not so much, but I was willing to adapt. I was thankfully spared the HR screening (maybe because I was an internal referral, or perhaps due to HR ineptitude, as demonstrated later on in the process), and spoke to the hiring manager directly on the phone. Really pleasant conversation, checked all boxes (or so I thought), no questions about my current salary level (strange). They very quickly reached out to bring me on-site for a round of interviews with the team. I accommodated their request and spent half a day to drive to Sunnyvale and meet with 5 people in 3 rounds (1 manager, then 1 manager + 1 employee together, then another 2 employees together). Still no questions about my salary... All 3 people/groups asked me EXACTLY the same questions, very standard "basic interview" ones. What really bothered me was that they could have saved time by combining all 5 people into one interview. I had to rehash the same old story 3 times in a row. Maybe they wanted to see if I changed it? The last two women were clearly reading the canned questions from their laptops. After returning home I immediately followed up with HR to reaffirm my (honest) interest in the position. The response I received was that the hiring manager was out of the office but he\'d "committed to reviewing the feedback and getting a decision as quickly as possible!" and "Let\u2019s plan to connect next week once I have the feedback to discuss next steps, etc.". A couple of weeks after this last email I went on vacation, and followed up with HR after returning. No response. A week after, I emailed my internal contact and I guess he forwarded my (disappointed at the lack of news) email to the hiring manager who promptly emailed me to 1) tell me the job was given to someone else and 2) blame HR for not telling me "I apologize for not getting back to you sooner." (how about, more precisely, NEVER?). I replied that from a company focused on recruiting best practices I expected a better treatment. No response from either the hiring manager nor the HR rep. Classy.']
[u'Started with a HR interview, then MNGR, then an all day interview, which consisted of interviewing with individuals you will support and your peers. There is a big portion on a case scenario in regards to databases and SQL.']
[u"I applied on LinkedIn and was contacted by a recruiter within a couple days. After a pleasant and insightful initial screening, the recruiter said that she'd love to set me up for a follow-up interview with the hiring manager. She also asked me how much I was making annually and then said that LinkedIn doesn't disclose their salary ranges, but that my expected salary is definitely within the range of the role. I didn't hear back and followed up with her a couple times. The team seemed to be really busy and eventually, 2-3 weeks later, I had my phone interview with the hiring manager. She sounded amazing and so did the role. The recruiter then told me the next day they'd like me to move forward to a first round of interviews with the team, which I was really excited about. Then I never heard back from them... so I followed up and found out that the recruiter had left her role. Looks like I fell through the crack, so I nagged the hiring manager to see how far they were in the process and eventually got back in the process. Long story short, it was an unnecessarily long interview process (almost 3 months) because of busy schedules, turnover (likely not very often) and just slow (or maybe complex) scheduling process. The first half of my interview experience was negative (because I had to follow up multiple times with the recruiter every step of the way and I felt like I had to really want the job). The second half of my interview experience was good (got assigned to a new recruiter, who was great and beyond helpful), but there were negative elements from the first half of the process that we didn't discover until much later. For example, the job level changed (along with the salary expectations) midway through the process (but I didn't find out that the salary range was now 20-30% less than what I expected until I received the offer). I really liked all the people I met with, but the process perplexed me. For such a seemingly nimble company with smart people, they don't seem to have the critical processes figured out (as with documenting recruiting notes and ensuring these were passed along). Maybe it was an isolated incident and I'm sure there were other factors at play, but it seemed like they were taking their sweet time filing the role despite the team being stretched really thin. I appreciate the genuine interest they have in making sure that they're hiring the right candidate for the role and that each candidate has enough runway to succeed. I also appreciate that management takes into consideration how the candidate compares to other people on the team, instead of just looking at the candidate's years of experience, regardless of whether they're relevant to the role. It does seem like they hire for specific types of people (there are lots of people from eBay, Google and prestigious consulting firms) and from conversations with the leadership team, they seem to value these specific experiences (which is fine, except that it doesn't create a very diverse team). The people I met were very nice and passionate about solving the problems that LinkedIn users face, but they didn't mention much about the overall vision of the company (is LinkedIn just getting started? What's next?). I received an offer that was 20% less than my expected salary. They were really kind and thoughtful in having the leadership team actually explain to me why they arrived at this compensation package, but it was still a not-so-great surprise after going through the long interview process thinking that it was going to align with my current salary (per conversation with the first recruiter). I was actually about ready to accept the offer if they had budged just slightly on the salary, bonus or RSU, but no such luck... again, I thought this was strange, considering that they had spent 3 months interviewing me, flying me to the Bay Area, and roughly 2 weeks putting together an offer and having the leadership team talk to me throughout the process."]
[u'Applied online with no internal referral, and a few days later there was a recruiter contacted me. For the phone interview, I was asked a multi-thread and thread safety question during the phone interview, for which I did not prepare. I was focusing on data structure, algorithm, and design. Given that I did not prepare for this type of questions, I was notified by the recruiter 2/3 days after the phone interview.']
[u"The recruiter reached out to me via email to see when I could talk more about the role. She missed our scheduled call and didn't reply to my email saying I was free later in the day in case she was running late. She got back to me saying she was out sick that day and wanted to reschedule. She was very hard to get in touch with and I had to get ahold her through a combo of Linkedin messages and email. Eventually, I saw on Linkedin that she changed companies! She gave me the contact info of who took over the job req, and luckily that person came through for me and I finally got a call with someone several weeks later. The intro call was fairly long. The recruiter ask some detailed questions specific to the role and went into Linkedin's mission and growth/areas of business. It took over a week for him to get back to me that the team was interested in moving to the next step, which was a call with someone in the hiring team. It then took another week or 2 to even get that called scheduled. Once it finally happened, I was asked how I'd improve Linkedin's product- both as an open ended question and in reference to 2 specific product features (I was able to choose which one I wanted to talk about/give recs on). Then there were standard questions like how do you interact with people who don't agree with your point of view and other behavioral stuff. After the call, it took the recruiter a week to get back to me that I didn't make the cut. However, had I still moved forward, he told me early on that next steps would've been an on site interview (2-3 hrs of 30 min interviews w/different members) and then a 2nd on site interview to give a presentation on a project to see how you go about solving a specific scenario."]
[u'Took a while to get the application in but I was eventually called in for an interview. It was pretty standard. Nice location, interviewer was pretty cool. I like the company overall but in the end was not offered a spot.']
[u'Recruiter emailed me and scheduled a phone call screen. After the phone screen I had a technical screen, which I got feedback on 5 minutes after the interview. There was another round of interviews with two people, one of them was coding on collabedit and the other was theoretical SRE questions. Recruiter let me know I made it to the next round, scheduled a phone call and made me an offer.']
[u'I was contacted via Linkedin, spoke to the recruiter first followed by interviews on the phone. Next was called on campus to interview. A number of folks interviewed and asked various types of questions - mix of behavioral, case study, and understanding of Linkedin and the tech industry.']

[u"Initial contact was a phone screen with a recruiter who was lovely, explained the process, and was the point of contact throughout the process. Was up-front about salary, which is always helpful to know whether you are wasting your time or not. 2nd round was a face-to-face interview with same recruiter, followed by 2 phone conversations with others in the role (3rd & 4th rounds), and then 5th round was a face-to-face with someone I would be working closely with. 6th round (which I didn't make it to) was to be a presentation to the head of APAC based in Singapore. Overall, the process was slow but positive. I did chase for updates a couple of times, recruiter was very apologetic and did keep me updated. Given the hyper-growth of LinkedIn in Australia in particular, I couldn't fault them for some delays due to scheduling."]

[u"Contacted by internal recruiter. Followed by two technical phone interviews and onsite. General hiring. All interviews come with a pair of interviewers; sometimes one of them is a shadow. Technical phone interviews are all algorithm questions. Onsite interview consists of 5-6 rounds; 2 design, 3 coding/algorithm, 1 behavioral. HR is very professional. Overall employees have high spirit. You got a gift basket containing your LinkedIn social map and some snacks; you'll need them at the end of the day."]
[u"I applied through Linkedin and got an email from recruiter after a week for a phone interview. The recruiter was 30 minutes late for the call. Not a great start. I was asked basic interview screening questions and went over my experience. The call took about an hour. The next working day I got an email from the recruiter requesting to organize a phone interview for me with the hiring manager. I replied with my availability but never got a response or confirmation of the interview. I emailed again to find out more but never got a response. I find it very rude that the recruiter didn't keep me up to date on what's going on, at least let me know I didn't get through."]
[u'Process took 6+ weeks and consisted of one phone interview, one Skype interview, one in-person interview. HR slow and unresponsive in communicating next steps. I had to follow up and move each stage along. Process seemed very disorganized.']

Basically to directly communicate with you to see if you'd be a good fit for the company to want to go through the interview process with you 2nd call - Technical phone interview #1 using Collabedit. Given two questions to solve in one hour. First question was to find the lowest common ancestor given two nodes and the second question was to determine if two strings are isomorphic (there exact question can be found on this site) 3rd call - Technical phone interview #2 also using Collabedit. Given two questions to solve in one hour as well. First question was find the largest subsequence given an array that yields the largest sum. The second question was a modification of the first that required me to find the largest subsequence of the given array that yields the largest PRODUCT. Didn't complete the code for the second question in time. Side note, recruiters were really easy to talk to and really speedy with their response."]
[u"I was contacted by a recruiter and the initial time to set up my interviews was fast. Everyone was very nice, respectful and I always left feeling very positive about the thought of working here, since everyone seemed to enjoy it so much. However, after 1 written and verbal presentation and over 2 months of interviews (on the phone, via Skype, and in person twice at two different office locations), they decided to go with another candidate. They give you a tablet to use while you wait for your in-person interivew at the headquarters - why, I don't know, but it was cool."]
[u"Got a recruiter called for phone interview after couple days applied for this position on Linkedin website. Scheduled for technical interview 2 days later.

[u'I was referred at LinkedIn. The recruitment team was prompt and very responsive to schedule changes. The lead recruiter was very informative on the phone and talked to me for half an hour explaining LinkedIn and understanding my interests. I was very impressed. First Phone Screen: Collabedit coding was expected with perfect language syntax Implement power function efficiently. Find maximum sum subset in an array with negative integers Second Phone Screen: Find if a string is a number or not. Repeat question of maximum sum subset. After telling them that I already answered this, they were surprised as the first interviewer had not left any notes! This was a hard problem which I had answered correctly. I was very disappointed. Variation of the same problem, maximum product subset. I faultered a bit and was not able to get to the right code. However my idea was correct.']
[u'It was one technical interview on skype. It included an online coding test. An algorithmic question.']

The first interview consisted of the Technical Publications manager telling me more about the job description. She touched base on their awesome internship program and the different projects I would be working on in the summer. She then asked me a little more about my portfolio and resume, touching base on the different projects and coursework I completed. After that, she invited me to ask any questions and I asked away! The manager then went on to explain how they will set up another interview for me with the technical writer team either in their office (Mountain View, CA) or over a video call.']
[u"Contacted by recruiters through linkedin, the process took less than a week, and then had an initial phone interview followed by another phone screen. After 2 days the recruiter got back to me providing a negative response. Nothing was serious, the questions are straightforward there is no tricks or any difficult problems, it's just if you did anything wrong and didn't correct it and even if you correct it; it could be a red flag to them, also the speed is very important. The recruiter didn't have much details to share with me and he told me that there is nothing serious, but, this is how it works, for me; I didn't know the criteria they judged about."]

The design challenge took about 30+ hours for me to complete, but I was sent out to HQ to present my challenge and other work in front of a group of designers. I had lunch in their cafeteria (which was delicious) and then three rounds of interviews with designers. Ultimately, I didn't get the job for reasons that I agreed/disagreed with, but I can't really complain. My one qualm is that in the process of getting reimbursed for my expenses, the problems I ran into took several days to be addressed."]

[u'I gave my resume to a recruiter when LinkedIn gave a tech talk at my university. I was contacted a few weeks later saying that they wanted to interview me. First there was a 10 minute chat to discuss my interests so they could know who I should interview with. Then they scheduled a technical phone interview where I was asked 2 technical questions. After that I got set up with the final round interviews 4 days later. The final round consisted of 3 phone interviews, two 1-hour technical interviews and one 30-min non-technical interview. Everyone was very friendly and helpful throughout the whole process.']

[u'Very well structured recruitment process. Was contacted by the company and the process was straight forward and short (3 interviews : HR, hiring manager, country manager). Just 2-3 candidates will get to the final interview with the country manager. In the end my experience was very positive and their might be other opportunities to join the company later even if the result was not positive for this one role.']
[u'Interview was an initial phone conversation followed by an onsite interview day. I was interviewed by 5 different people. They flew me out and put me up in a hotel. The interview process was pretty standard. It consisted of a technical coding interview where I had to write code on the white board, followed by a software design interview and then some interviews with the management. I also was given a tour of the campus and given a welcome to your interview pack. Hardest part of the interview was at the end with one of the executives, who tore apart my resume, questioned what I was wearing, swore and made me feel like a fraud!']

[u'1 phone interview and 1 on-site interview, pretty standard process']
[u"[Phone screens] Linkedin recruiting team reached out to me on Linkedin. They talked to me about what candidate they were looking for and explained to me in details the recruiting process. Then their recruiting coordinator quickly set up two phone screens. I enjoyed those two chats with data science lead and manager, who are very professional. They asked excellent technique and behavior questions that are closely relevant to the real data scientist job on a day to day base. Meanwhile, they are very friendly and they patiently answered all my questions regarding the potential role, work style, and team culture. [Onsite] Only a few days after the phone screens I was told I would be invited to an onsite. Once again they quickly set up the onsite and the traveling. I think the onsite was very well organized and it gave me a perfect opportunity to learn what my job would look like. It is really easy to tell that everyone I talked to are very smart and really know the stuff they are talking/asking. And I can tell they did their research on my background and asked great questions to best know me and assess my specialties. That really makes a difference and makes me feel that I am respected as a candidate. During the day, the hiring manager had been checking with me during the breaks to make sure that I had time to grab water and go to the bathroom, and that helped me a lot shaking off the stress and focusing on the interview itself. (BTW, the lunch was very enjoyable, and the cafe is the best.) By the end of the day, when I met my recruiters, they walked me through how the business is running and what is the battle plan for the next year. What they did really impressed me. I would highly recommend adding the 'mini business review' to every onsite because it provides huge amount of valuable info to the candidate. [Offer] The hiring manager is extremely helpful and he spent time talking to me on every questions/concerns I have. And I undoubtedly say that he is the best hiring manager I ever met. The recruiting team always respond promptly. The recruiting team leader did an exceptional job pushing forward the offer processing and understanding my concerns. Everyone is so helpful that it feels like talking to friends. [Overall] I really enjoyed the entire process from the very beginning. The data science and recruiting team delivered the best job-seeking experience to me."]

A few weeks later I was invited to speak with additional members of the HR team to ask me more job-related questions about how I execute on projects and my working style. It was straightforward."]
[u'Phone interview with a recruiter. Almost all questions can be found here.']
[u'I submitted my application through jobvite (funny, isn\'t it, since LinkedIn also have their own job application platform). I think I came accross the job posting on Glassdoor. Several days later, a recruiter contacted me about the phone screening. Due to the timezone difference (15 hours different), I had to wait a week for the first availability. The questions were standard just like other big tech companies\' interviews. A week later, I was told that they moved forward with another phone screening. A week of waiting and I was informed that they would do an "online" on-site interview instead of flying me to the US. I was really grateful that they did that because otherwise, it would be a long wait to get the visa and arrange things to fly over (I also had other interviews going on during that time). The onsite interview was split into two days as it consists of 7 rounds, each about 45 minutes. Each round covers different skills, with the first being a very generic round where I was asked various kinds of question about my background (I have a Master\'s in CS - research-based). Other rounds included questions revolving around the team I\'m applying to, and of course, programming questions. In one round, I spent around 15 minutes asking questions back and forth since I misunderstood the engineer, but we sorted it out in the end. One interviewer didn\'t show up, but somehow I was waived that interview thanks to the first interviewer (some big manager) being impressed with my background. The day after the interview, my recruiter emailed me and told me that they might have to do another round for the interviewer that didn\'t show up. I was really pissed at that point because I had to wake up really early here to match the time in the US, but I agreed anyway. However, an hour later my recruiter informed me that they decided to waive that round since I impressed the big manager who interviewed me first. Overall, the process was smooth. My recruiter was very quick to answer my questions, but I felt 7 rounds for the onsite were too much compared to other companies I interviewed with (Google and Amazon). However, the engineers were really laid-back and I really enjoyed discussing with them. Some of them appeared a bit cold and distant, but they were no less helpful when it comes to clarifying the ideas and providing feedback. Note that I interviewed with also Amazon and Google, and I think the standards are similar across the three companies.']

Not too hard, just some typical algorithm questions.']
[u'Interview process began with an initial phone screen, followed by a technical q&a phone screen, and a coding phone screen.

The whole process was very well organized and very transparent.']

[u'Got selected through campus recruiting and had my first phone interview. The interviewer seemed like he was not interested at all, and did not communicate well during the interview.

[u"Phone interview, followed by another phone interview, which was exactly the same, just different questions, followed by nothing... Yes, that's right. On the first interview, I solved the given problem. Then they scheduled another phone interview. It went well, however, I found the interviewers to be really unprofessional, kind of rude. The whole process felt like I was talking to machines reading a script. Really, no human factor in the whole process. At this point I knew I did not want to work for this company. I wrote the recruiter an email expressing my disappointment. He replied saying he will take a look and give me back feedback. I never heard again. I accepted another offer, but out of curiosity, and for the purpose of this review, I decided to call the recruiter 10 days later. The guy told me he left LinkedIn for another opportunity, and that he also really disliked how things were done there. We ended up laughing about it together, and congratulating each other on our new gigs outside of LinkedIn!! My recommendation is the following. I would never work for a company that treats applicants like an assembly line. Know that they are lucky you decided to apply, and they should know that too. They should make you feel comfortable on the phone, and motivate you to solve the problem, not just throw you a question and sit back, read a script."]
[u'Talked with a LinkedIn representative at the university job fair and dropped my resume.

[u"It was one of the most organized interview process I have participated. Thumbs up to Linkedin and the recruitment team. They were always giving me feedback during the process. 1. It started with the phone screen by the recruiter with a few basic technical questions just to filter the candidates. 2. After that you are scheduled with 2 technical phone interviews with other Site Reliability Engineers. The first is generic and include everything that you can imagine, from linux to network, fundamentals, databases, troubleshooting, etc. The second is a code interview, you both share a document and you are given a few operational challenges to solve. You pick the language to use. I really enjoyed that because I'm not a software engineer and I'm used to code stuffs to solve operational problems and that's what they want for a SRE. 3. If you pass the phone interviews then you are set to go onsite and have the full day interview with more SREs. The onsite is similar to the first generic phone interview, but now all those topics are interviewed by an expert in that area and go as deep as you can keep answering him. This is the challenge part :) 4. Once I was done with the onsite interview it took around 1 week to get the offer, but during that week I got a lot of feedback from the recruiter and she said I passed the process and they were discussing the offer and the SRE team that I would fit. I really enjoyed the process, it was more difficult than what I expected and the communication was great with the recruiters. All the steps above are communicated to you once you pass each of them, including the interview topics you are expected to have."]

The recruiter was professional enough and timely setting up my phone interview. The team manager who interviewed me however, was a rather opposite experience. On the day of the scheduled interview I was called 20 minutes late for what was set up to be a 45 minute interview. When asked about why I was looking to leave my current job they followed with accusatory statements insinuating the company's lack of investment in my area didn't make sense if I had been doing a good job. I was asked a series of SQL questions which I was told would get increasingly difficult to assess the upper limit of my SQL knowledge. The 4th question was taking me quite a bit more time than the prior 3 so I was cut off, told to do it later on my own time, and send them the results if I figured it out. At that point it was the end time for the originally scheduled interview when they said they had to run to a meeting but if I had any questions for them they could answer in the next minute or 2 I could ask them now."]

[u'I was contacted shortly (maybe a week) after applying on their website. First, a recruiter was assigned to me and would be my direct contact to work with for the entire process. She arranged a time to call me and interview me mostly to tell me how the interview process would go, to determine if I was a good cultural fit, and to get to know me in general. She too her results back to her recruiting manager. Second, she arranged a first round interview with me and gave me their LinkedIn profile so I knew them a bit ahead of time and could gear my questions around that knowledge. It was probably a 45 minute interview (they were very respectful of the time allotted) where I was asked basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript questions. Next, my recruiter arranged a 95 minute time frame for two 45 minute interviews with a break between. These interviews were tougher with more technical, down and dirty questions including live coding through collabedit. I felt comfortable through the entire process and enjoyed having a personal recruiter to report to/talk with.']
[u'Applied online through LinkedIn, received an email from a recruiter in a week to set up a call. Initial chat lasted about 20 mins, and was about some basic background and interests, no technical questions. Then he scheduled the first technical phone interview.

IMO, one of my biggest assets is my ability to synergize new solutions and build bridges that cross company boundaries. Indeed, this is what the VP wanted from me. However, in the interview process everyone else was determined to pigeon hole me (he's a developer, he's an architect, he's not an OPs guy, ....) and so the whole thing was a disaster of mis-matched expectations. I came away with the feeling that LinkedIn is an overly structured company, lacking in agility, and, worse, they admire themselves for this."]

[u'I was referred by a friend, and then contacted by an internal recruiter. I chatted with him for a while, and a phone interview was scheduled. The phone interview was fairly standard. I had told the recruiter that I was most comfortable interviewing in Python, or C++ in a pinch. This apparently didn\'t get passed along to the interviewer, who asked me to code some stuff in Java. I was also asked about my experience, although it almost seemed like he was waiting for me to say the right magic word in the answer than actually listening about what I\'d done. I was told by the recruiter that they\'d like me to do more interviews, and that those would be coordinated by a different recruiter. For the next 3 weeks, this recruiter kept telling me he\'d be in touch "soon". That never happened, despite me repeatedly reminding him. Then he disappeared on vacation for the holidays. I don\'t know if he was being lazy, or what. I still haven\'t been contacted, or told that I\'m no longer being considered, so who knows.']

As SRE isn't really what I have been doing, the job description he provided didn't really click with me. He has also asked some basic DNS lookup question, linux questions about what system calls related to listing files and what tool you can use to check I/O load. I passed this part. As I am a sys admin so this was easy for me. The second interview was conducted by a junior technical staff in the team. The recruiter has sent me exactly what would be asked. HTTP browser request, how to monitor a website, to distribute loads of files fast and accurrately. The interviewer did ask all these questions and a bit more. unfortunately I don't have experience with websites. I am more a sys admin. so i was just really guessing what i would have done. like detect via load balancer, error logs in apache etc. I didn't get to the next stage."]
[u'Had an initial call with a recruiter followed by two phone screens and 4 onsite interviews as part of LinkedIn Invitational. Recruiting did a great job showing us around, and a few of the engineers made a really strong impression on me. However for the most part I found the interviewers to be cold, deliberately vague, and frustrating. In one case, the interviewer would frantically grab his notepad and start scribbling furiously every time I made a mistake. It was that obvious. Compared to my interviews at Google (received an offer), although the process at both places was largely robotic technical interviewing, I felt LinkedIn interviewers were much more difficult to connect with.']
[u'Had One HR Phone screening followed by one technical round on phone. I didnot do well so could not get through the technical round.']
[u'1st round Phone Screen: The lady was sweet and asked what position I was interested in and the general HR questions like what am I looking for in an internship. 2nd round Phone Technical: Given a sorted array with duplicates and a number, find the range in the form of (startIndex, endIndex) of that number. For example, find_range({0 2 3 3 3 10 10}, 3) should return (2,4). find_range({0 2 3 3 3 10 10}, 6) should return (-1,-1). The array and the number of duplicates can be large.']
[u"I had 3 phone interviews with Linkedin data scientists. Everyone I spoke to was very bright, thoughtful and polite and made a great impression. On the first two calls I was asked how I would solve some of the problems Linkedin worked on (ex: people you may know) and on the third call I had a more technical coding interview. However I didn't have a machine learning background at the time, so they did not give me an offer but encouraged me to e-apply after I had taken some of the machine learning classes I was planning to take the next semester. Considering how little machine learning I knew at the time it's a wonder they even gave me a first interview, let alone 3."]
[u'1. phone interview; 2. face-to-face group interview for 1 hr, with 1 hr of test; 3. face-to-face with director and another senior language manager.']
[u'Multiple phone and onsite interviews. They use a standard set of interview coding questions, and you can practice for them. Focus on tree traversal.']
[u'Recruitment process is based on a initial phone interview with HR, followed by a phone interview with the hiring manager. After this you will have a personal interview that includes a "role play" with a sales situation']
[u'The process is really smooth. I applied online. The recruiter got back to me within a week and set up an initial screening one week later. For interns, interview only have two rounds. First round is a 1-hour technical phone interview. 2nd round is 2 back-to-back 45-minute phone interviews. The interview questions are pretty standard. My recruiter called me a few hours after my 1st round interview and moved me to the 2nd round. After the 2nd round, it took them a while to give me the decision. However, generally, my recruiter is really helpful and very responsive to my questions along the way. In terms of the interview difficulty, the questions are very standard. Certainly practicing "Cracking the code interview" will help. Definitely "talk as you think". Let the interviews know what you are thinking. Write clean code. Avoid major bugs. Try to show that you are a smart and sharp person.']
[u"The first interview was a phone screen with the technical recruiter. It was mostly an opportunity to hear about the state of LinkedIn and see if it's a good fit for you. The recruiter asked me about my current skills and roles. The second phone call was with a two session, 45 minutes each, phone code challenge using collabedit. The questions were both frontend questions about markup, css and javascript. If you know these three intimately, you'll be okay. The developers I talked with were really great and were really interested in talking through the process with you, so don't get carried away just typing, talk through your process. The last interview was an onsite. The recruiter met me at the lobby and walked with me to the interview room and explained to me how the interview process was going to go. They give you an itinerary with everyone's name on it, which is really nice to offload one more thing you have to stress about through the day. We had a great conversation about what the recruiter liked about LinkedIn, about where I currently work and just life in general until my first technical interview. Each technical interview (of which there were 7 questions), was about an hour, and a mix of culture/skills questions and whiteboard questions. These questions ranged from moderate to difficult, and they all require you to think through the process of solving the problem. You really need to know html and css with 100% certainty, and you need to know your javascript well. There were two CSS challenges and 5 javascript challenges, almost all of them involved also writing the markup to correlate with them. Overall, this has been the best interview experience I've ever had, and I've had some really great interview experiences. LinkedIn seems like the kind of place anyone with a passion for development/engineering would love to be."]
[u'Applied online and got contacted several hours later. First I have a phone screen with the recruiter. I chose the groups I am interested and scheduled a technical phone interview. After I passed the first phone interview, I got called by the recruiter and scheduled two back-to-back phone interviews with two teams from my first-choice group. After the two interviews was a 30-min talk. Got offers from both teams and I gotta choose one of them.']
[u"First they contacted me and told me about the internship like what it is about and what we are going to do there and benefits. Later they asked me whether I won't to go forward with interview process or not. I agreed and then they asked me to give the dates for the interview. There were 2 technical and 1 HR interview. All of them were telephonic interview. First interview was a technical one. It was mostly oriented toward C++ and object oriented paradigm. They also asked me to explain the projects I had done in the college. Second interview was also a technical one but it was totally a coding one. 3 questions in 1 hour. All the question were related to data structures and its applications. Third interview was with hiring manager. It was mostly related to what I had done so far in college, experience of working in a team and about my future plans."]
[u'Applied in October end almost 4 weeks.']
[u'Applied to the position via Linkedin. Was contacted by a recruiter for an initial phone screen to discuss the job. Scheduled a 1-hour technical phone screen with 2 engineers the following week. During the interview, we used collabedit. Most of the interview consisted of technical trivia questions with one coding exercise using Python with regular expressions.']
[u"I applied at my university's career fair. I got a call from the recruiter about two months later and we set up a call to talk about my interests. My first round interview was on the phone using collabedit, and was technical. I was asked to program a function that analyzed sets and sets within those sets. I solved it with a BFS/DFS variant. Though I felt I answered the questions correctly, I knew that I was a little nervous and was unsure if I'd make it to the next round. Just a couple business days later, I got a call notifying me that I would be interviewing in the final round. I got to choose the teams with which I interviewed. Each of the two final round interviews was technical, but the third phone call was casual. One technical question was a greedy interval scheduling problem, and the other was a binary search variant. I was also asked really specific questions about a data structure, but was not expected to know it all. The conversations went really well and just two days later I got a call with the offer. Overall, none of the questions were easy, but nor were they extremely difficult. If you know your data structures and did well in your algorithms course, you will be prepared."]
[u'Applied online, was contacted morning after to schedule phone screening for same day. Was a 30 min. high-level, usual generic questions, conversational. Next, phone interview with hiring manager, same length around 25/30 min. no tricky questions, why you want to work at LinkedIn and why this position kind of questions. For the 3rd round, had to prepare for a sales role play exercise/presentation which was not a big deal but do prepare for it.']
[u'I was contacted by the recruiting team, who expressed interest in my portfolio. I had three phone interviews and was then asked to make a presentation and have more interviews. Everyone was so nice and very eager to talk design which I loved. I had interviews with nine people in total, paired into twos. We all had great chemistry.']
[u'Applied through the university. Was able to bypass the initial phone screen due to my "qualifications" (however they told my friends this as well). One 45 minute interview for the first round. Two back to back 45 minute interviews for the second round. Was extended an offer a week later. Allowed to pick between a few different teams interested in taking me on. Pay was above average, just had a more interesting offer in the city.']
[u'Had a phone interview in the initial round.The question involved recursion.Interviewer was very much cool and the interview challenging.']
[u'They recruited me through LinkedIn. Brought me right in to begin meeting the team and to start the interview process. The recruiter was super helpful all through the process.']
[u'Had 1st round as technical phone interview. Interviewer shared a document and asked to write the code. The questions was not the difficult. He asked me to implement List interface of java. I had to implement all add, get and remove methods using any data structure']
[u'Love the fact that when going through LinkedIn you can see/ reach out to the job poster. Sent the HR contact a direct message and got a prompt reply. Almost unheard of in this day and age.']
[u"I originally submitted an application through my university's career page. I got a follow-up e-mail from the campus recruiter, as well as another recruiter, asking me to attend the info session and sign up for an interview. The info session wasn't very detailed about the actual rotational program, but they really emphasized the culture at LinkedIn, and how they're really out to change the world. I had my interview the next morning, and it was a fairly standard behavioral interview. It's definitely more chatty than formal. He seemed primarily interested in my consulting background, and how well I could integrate myself into the LinkedIn atmosphere. They really, really care about cultural fit."]
[u'First contact was on Oct 23rd via email from a technical recruiter and we scheduled a phone call for next day. She talked about positions available at the moment asked what would interest me the most. After I picked one area she scheduled first phone screen on Oct 25th. First phone screen was with a Sr. Data Scientist, she made a very good introduction of the project on which she works. I was asked what projects I worked on before and what am looking for now. Than a few simple questions related to data science. Second phone screen was a coding interview and was scheduled for the Nov 1st and they used collabedit.com to code. The problem was interesting and after some discussion and hints I was able to verbalize the most efficient solution and then proceeded to coding it in C. It took some discussion and time before I got it and the interviewer at no time was trying to fail me, he was very helpful and treated me super nicely. Couple days later they informed me that I passed and scheduled on site interview for Nov 7th. On site I had 5 interviews 45min each, two data scientists, one product manager, one coding (simple SQL), one lunch interview with the hiring team member. All questions are reasonable, no brain teasers or tricky questions, no one is trying to fail you and people are genuinely super nice. After that I had couple more meetings with engineering team members. Overall it took almost the entire day. Two days later I was told that they would like to make me an offer and gave me all the details. I was on a tough schedule because I had another pending offer and LinkedIn HR pulled out a little miracle to make all the process super smooth and fast. It took 2 weeks from the first contact to the offer stage, and this is not an easy thing to do trust me!!! They handle all the logistics, all you need to think about is just to concentrate on the interviews itself. Overall, LinkedIn interview process is as good as it possibly gets and they pay really good money so it is for sure worth fighting for.']
[u'Best interview process. Recruiter was extremely knowledgeable about my experience and the mapping to the job opening. I was passive talent-happy in my previous role.']

[u"On campus hiring for MBA graduates - had to apply through the school's hiring process. A shortlist was sent out a week later, with one more week to prepare for the interview. Initial interview conducted by a single Sr. Product Manager. Friendly, started off with her own introduction and then Tell Me About Yourself. Went on to product questions - what product in the market do you like and why, what do you not like and how would you improve it, how would you get X & Y teams to buy into your proposed change, what product do you think LinkedIn should invest in going forward and which ones does it not have to invest too much in, any questions for me?"]
[u'Applied online, recieved an email from recruiter to set up a call. Initial chat about opportunities and was communicated I will be interviewd for application team. First round telephonic interview. 1 coding question and reject. /** * Given two (dictionary) words as Strings, determine if they are isomorphic.

[u'Current MBA student, applied to PM New Grad position. Had attended the LinkedIn PM tour earlier in the summer for MBA students in PM roles in the Bay Area. Had an initial call with HR after which a "technical interview" was scheduled with a PM. The technical interview had nothing technical about it, just 4 questions - about myself, my internship projects, why PM-role/why LinkedIn, and whether I\'d been involved in a product launch. A 45 minute interview that ended in less than 25 minutes. A few days later I heard back saying they decided not to move ahead with my candidacy. I\'m not sure on what basis the decision was made (because nothing was asked that wasn\'t already on my resume). I spent a week researching the company inside out, had some great (in my view) suggestions and ideas but the interview seemed like a formality to reject my candidacy. Feel let down by the company and the process.']
[u'My interview was very laid back and casual. Met with a couple of managers who asked me very basic questions about previous positions, where I saw myself in the future etc.']
[u'Long interview process! They take their time to make sure the best person is offered the job.']
[u'On campus recruiting process. LinkedIn employees are very friendly & approachable. Passed the first round and got invited to New York for second-round interviews. The office maintains a fun, start-up-like culture while being a large, IPO-listed company. There are snacks and the office is fast expanding (at least in New York). Overall a good interview experience, although I decided to go with another opportunity.']
[u'Got a call from Linkedin recruitment team to set up a call. The call was 40 mins late but lasted about 30 minutes - started with behavioral questions and then told me about the growth and business in Australia, the HR structure, the products they sell. Quite informative and well covered.']

[u"Had 2 phone interviews, supposed-to-be-five-but-turned-out-to-be-seven rounds of onsite interviews. 3 were system architecture and design related rounds. Found those a bit hard as compared to the coding & algorithmic questions. Overall experience was average. Post lunch interviewers were less experienced I'm assuming, because one of them yawned non-stop and a couple others had taken a vow not to speak during the interviews."]
[u'Initially contacted by recruiter over LinkedIn message. Had one phone screen with HR asking about my past experiences and my interest in development. Had a 30 minute phone interview with an employee asking about basic CSS and HTML concepts like box model and tags. Third round included two 45 minute interviews with coding required. First gave a image and asked to code something similar to that layout. Second was more coding, but much more difficult']
[u'The interview process consisted of 3 phone interviews and an on-site interview. The first interview was comprised of basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript questions as well as just getting to know me (this was done by the recruiter). The next two phone interviews were technical. The first had no coding involved but was more of getting an understanding of my thought process of certain things as well as asking more in-depth technical questions. The second one involved 2 coding questions that asked me to recreate a module with HTML and CSS then perform a certain action on it using Javascript. The onsite interview was essentially like the third phone interview as it involved 4 technical interviews and 1 just getting an understanding of how much I knew the company and why I wanted to work for Linkedin. Overall it was a great process and I learned so much about coding and the culture throughout the entirety of it.']
[u'Long interview process. 5-6 stages. First with HR, then line manager, another line manager, a role play and offer. In all it took around 3 months']
[u"- be prepared to describe why you want to work for LinkedIn... not just cause its a cool tech company but because of why it's doing something that you want to be a part of! - know how we make money! - don't apply for a job here and not have a LI profile"]
[u'The process was a great experience. The main thing I enjoyed about it is it felt more like conversations rather then me getting grilled. I had just come off interviewing for Lab 126 where I was put on the spot with lame scenario questions and was even ask the same ones more than once. LinkedIn hires for culture. I love that.']
[u"The interview process consists of two phone screens: a technical phone screen and then a programming-oriented phone screen. The technical phone screen covered a lot of questions that basically boil down to: do you know what's going on on your systems? For example, what can you glean from the Apache logs on a webserver, and how would you know how performance was being impacted. (too many users hitting the server, or not enough resources allocated, etc) There were also operating system level questions. A few off the top of my head: - If you have an executable program (a binary) and you made a copy of that program, and then changed permissions on the copy, would a diff show that the file had been changed? - When you run a program from the shell, why doesn't the program log you out when it's done running? If you wanted this behavior, how would you run the program? (answer: exec) - Talk me through what happens when you make an ssh connection to a remote machine. Be able to be specific, such as the identification string exchange, algorithm negotiation, key exchange, etc. - Name as many TCP flags as you can. (URG, ACK, PSH, RST, SYN, FIN - mnemonic: Unskilled Attackers Pester Real Security Folks.) - What protocol(s) do/does DNS use when you run an nslookup. (answer: normally UDP, but TCP is used for zone transfers and if a record is too long to be returned via UDP) - Describe the difference between TCP and UDP, advantages and disadvantages of both. - When I try to connected to a remote machine using (for example) ssh, how does ssh know how to get to that remote machine. (be able to describe routing, default routes, and host name lookup.) The programming portion of the interview tests your ability to program in the scripting language of your choice. You can use common languages such as Perl, Python, Ruby, or PHP. You cannot use Bash or other shell interpreters (no sh, ksh, csh, etc) This part of the interview tripped me up a little bit, as most of my programming is oriented towards systems engineering problems. I write scripts to parse logs, distribute files, perform backups, etc. I don't do a lot of CS type programming. Unfortunately, the screener threw several of these types of problems at me, and it kinda threw me for a loop. I was able to solve these problems, but I'm sure I didn't instill the screener with a lot of confidence. - Write a perl program that prints a 12x12 multiplication table matrix. - Write a program that reverses the contents of a file, byte for byte. - Write a program that counts from 1 to 100. For each number, print a certain string if the number is evenly divisible by 6. Print a different string if the number is evenly divisible by 4. Print yet another string if the number is evenly divisible by 24. If none of these cases match, print the number. - Write a program that descends through a directory tree and prints all files. (hint: recursion is your friend here.) - Given an Apache log file, print the timestamp hour, minute, and second, followed by the number of times any log entry occurs during that time. (hint: if you're programming in perl, a hashed array works great here.)"]
[u'Very efficient and time-friendly process - not more than 4 people involved and generally 3 main steps: phone, face-to-face and presentation stage. Excellent communication during the whole process both with Hiring manager and HR Operations. Not more than 40min length of the interviews, semi-structured questions which allow you to give details']

They were happy I didn't have more than 20 slides, the last guy before me had over 50.

I later on got contacted by the sales rep who sold us the solution (Ciara Desmond) who told me about this awesome opportunity that was coming up in the Nordic region. She gave me the job description and I was later on contacted by Dave (a recruiter) who answered tons of my questions and through him introduced to Lars Ingerslev (manager) who answered some more questions. After all this I had a Skype interview with Dave Burges and then a proper interview with Lars Ingerslev...and then a last call with Dave and after that the job was mine =)']
[u'Even the most stressful part of the job (the interview) was a fantastic experience. I was recommended by a friend and from that moment on, it was amazing. I met with one of the top management, and as soon as he asked HR to contact me, then it was no longer stressful at all. Sarah (HR rep who interviewed me) was the most professional recruiter I dealt with in a long time. Always keeping me informed of the status of the process, calling me with feedback or emailing me with preparation tips prior interviews.']
[u'This had to be one of my favorite interviews in a while. I ended up meeting with two sales managers initially. It ended up being a great conversation and just learning about each others backgrounds. They asked direct questions about why I wanted to work there, culture and why I thought there was a fit. They were also open to answering the many questions I had. Finally a third person, the Director came in and we did a case together. This was the best part of the interview. You knew the deck was stacked against you on the information front. They know the business better than you and you have to remain calm, do your best and be open to feedback. The feedback from the case was open, constructive and honest. I really liked how they delivered it and that encouraged me to continue our conversations and accept the job offer.']

[u'I was contacted by a recruiter through LinkedIn. I first had a 30 minute phone conversation with the recruiter about my interests, LinkedIn, and the role they thought would be a good fit for me. He said the usual process is two technical phone interviews followed by an onsite.']
[u'First discussion was with the recruiter, who provided some background on the individuals in the group, the purpose for hiring for the position (i.e. more info than "we\'re busy / last person moved on), the culture of the company and the group. They also asked about my current role and salary. Comp in my industry is fairly well known so I wasn\'t too fussed about disclosing this early. There were some emails from a recruiting coordinator to deal with interview logistics. The first round consisted of 4 one-on-one interviews. Pretty standard questions. They were trying to determine if my skill set, experiences, etc were genuine or if I fluffed my CV. They were also getting a sense as to my personality to see if I\'d be a good fit for the team and the company. The first day ended with a short discussion with the recruiter. The recruiting coordinator contacted me later that day to set up the 2nd round of interviews. The second consisted of 4 one-on-one interviews, one of which was someone from round 1. Again, pretty standard, though the questions were a bit more detailed. The second day ended with me just leaving campus. The recruiter later phoned to tell me I would receive an offer that week pending reference checks.']
[u'Very intense.....they only want the best and the brightest and make sure to have a vigorous interviewing process']

But I've already had two other interviews that day and gets pretty tired. And the younger engineer was keep pushing me and talking all the time when I was coding and show how knowledgeable he is. He interrupts me all the time, even when I call a helper function which I plan to implement later. I can't think under this situation and skewed up the interview. One week later the recruiter called me to inform me about the rejection, when I'm in a lecture."]
[u'Hiring process was very easy. Initial phone screening with hiring manager, then invited in for multiple panel interviews (1 round with immediate peers, 1 round with people on other teams I would be working with, and 1 round with my hiring manager). Was sent an offer the following week.']
[u"Was easy. I was recruited directly by my manager. Our initial conversations were exploratory and then I was brought in for formal interviewing. I met with our Sr. Director and had one of the most fun interview experiences I've ever had. We didn't just talk the position and my experience, they knew that already, we talked strategy and other topics and we got to learn how one another thinks. Unlike any other interview I've had before."]
[u'A phone screen with a recruiter, 2 phone screens with web devs (a questions-based interview, and a coding-based conference) and 4 on-campus interviews (3 technical, one with a manager). The process was very rigorous, however, I felt like the interviewers where working with you to determine what you do know, rather than trying to trip you up.']
[u'There are one to two phone screens, then an onsite that consists of five modules.']
[u'Two one on one in-person interviews, followed by a presentation to a group.']
[u'Took quite a while to get an onsite interview. Reached out through a contact internally. Initial phone screen after 1 week. Then a second phone screen after 2-3 weeks. Then finally invited onsite for a presentation. Never received word back after this. Reached out after 2 weeks and was not offered a position. Most of the team was very polite and nice. Not really sure what they were looking for in a team member as I thought I performed very well on the interview overall.']
[u'I have to say that is probably one of the worst interview experiences that I\'ve ever had. It\'s too bad, because I really believe that this is a great company with a great culture. I was referred to this position for an internal employee. The recruiter reached out initially to set up a time to do a phone screen. She asked me for availability - I gave her days and times and then I heard nothing. I reached out again, she suggested two times, and I picked one and asked her to confirm. She never confirmed. I had to reschedule so I reached out and suggested two more times. She didn\'t respond until I sent an e-mail asking what was going on. I suggested that maybe this was a courtesy interview because I was an internal referral and if that was the case, I really didn\'t want to waste her time or mine. She finally got back to me and apologized saying that was not the case, and confirmed a phone screen time for me. The phone screen was weird. She was totally unfamiliar with the job and it seemed that she hadn\'t even reviewed my resume. She suggested she needed a full salary history, I thought this was a weird place to do this - but I did submit it (I don\'t really think my current salary has anything to do with how I would negotiate for this position - but if the information made her feel better, I was happy to supply it). She then went on to explain that even though the job was advertised in Mountain View, CA that the job was actually going to be located in Omaha, NE. I was surprised. When I asked why the discrepancy in the posting, she told me that they weren\'t getting the right kind of candidates from the Omaha area, and they thought they could find more appropriate applicants from the Bay Area. This was a shock to me, but I was interested in the position and figured I\'d continue with the process. She got in contact within a day or two and said that the hiring manager wanted to meet with me but it would need to be done ASAP as she was going on vacation. I did some re-arranging of my schedule to fit in a phone screen - and again had to reach out 2 times to get a confirmation of my phone interview. The interview with the hiring manager went well. It was short (30 mins). After that interview was finished it was a week before I heard anything from the recruiter. Again, I thought the process was over, but was surprised when I got a request to do 3 more interviews. A recruiting assistant scheduled those interviews and it was relatively painless. I talked to 3 different managers at the Omaha location who all seemed passionate, smart and dedicated. After these three interviews, I heard nothing. I reached out on 3 different occasions (limiting my contact to once per week) but every attempt to reach out was left unanswered. I finally decided to withdraw my application from the process. I\'m a passionate believer in the fact that companies will show you how they treat their employees through the interview process. I wrote a very nice "thanks but no thanks e-mail", similar to the ones that applicants get from companies all the time! Within 4 hours I got an e-mail from the recruiter asking me why. I explained my reasoning as nicely as I could telling her that from the very beginning I shared with her my desire to work for a company that treats their employees well. I told her that the lack of communication, follow up and concern for me as an applicant was indicative of a company that can\'t respect employees. She begged me to re-join the process, told me that the hiring manager was VERY interested in me and wanted me to move onto the next phase, but vacation schedules had made the process drag on. She told me that it was her fault that I hadn\'t received follow up, and please don\'t blame the company. A week and a half later, I got a phone call from someone I\'ve never talked to before. She went on for about 10 minutes about how the hiring manager and the other managers really liked me and wanted me to move on, and then in some awkward point in the conversation, she said, "but you lack domain expertise". We had covered this is in the interview and I knew that, but I was told that "fit" and "passion" were more important, so I didn\'t think anything about it. But then she started in on "if we know of other positions, we\'ll keep you in mind" and I was confused and suddenly realized what they were saying. I said, "so I\'m not moving on" and she said "correct". I said, thanks and goodbye. It was absolutely the strangest phone call I\'ve ever had from a recruiter. I\'m not used to talking to recruiters that aren\'t straight talking and honest.']
[u"Applied through the LinkedIn website and was contacted by a recruiter via email for setting up the initial phone screen. Phone screen was usual, why did you select computer science, tell us about yourself a little, which field I was interested in working so they could select the appropriate team. First round went well, consisted of one coding question and some machine learning concepts. Was contacted a week later and was set up for 2 back to back phone interviews. Second round was similar to the first, a coding question and some more machine learning concepts. Third round was all about complexity and Big O analysis, nothing too hard. Overall, a very good learning experience even though I didn't make it."]
[u"I dropped my resume in our school's career fair and got the phone interview after a few days. The lady was very cheerful and we talked about my personal interest and stuff. Later she asked to do some coding questions on data structure. The questions are fair but I think I forgot a lot of details."]
[u'Applied for the position at Linkedin.com and the recruiter reached out to me about 2 weeks later. Started with a phone screen with the recruiter around Wednesday and then a call scheduled with the hiring manager by Friday. I was invited to an on-site interview the following week on Tuesday-ish with 3 interviews (2~3 people interviewing me each time). On my home after the interview, I got a call from the recruiter stating that I got an offer. Campaign managers are in AdOps, so the questions revolved around interactions with Sales, clients, and QA abilities.']
[u"LinkedIn contacted me, presumably from a search of their own site. I was contacted by email which led to a phone interview. The phone interview asked several fit and interest questions. The phone interview was followed by two pair-programming interviews in which JS Fiddle was used to determine my skillset. The first interview focused on general style and markup questions and the second focused on JS Fundamentals and pattern questions. Based on the interview and some of the more advanced JS questions I was fairly confident that I was out. They exercises weren't complicated, but it was obvious that I had a lack of experience in using them in application development (up to this point I had been more of a Corporate vanity site developer.)"]
[u'Phone interview with hiring manager and then invited on-site to meet with 3 interviewers. I was also given a tour of the campus and had the opportunity to eat lunch with the team. It was an amazing candidate experience. LinkedIn is an awesome company and their recruiting team is killing it!']
[u'Great quick & thorough and they give you a gift bag.']
[u'went through 2 phone interviews.Typical CTCI and Careercup questions. The HR was prompt and courteous']
[u'Came in to give a sales pitch after a series of phone calls. They give you material to study before the pitch. You must know this material and demonstrate it during your pitch. They went on to have me interview with a sales dev specialist team leader and the sales dev manager. Overall everyone was vey nice and gave immediate feedback.']
[u'(for summer internship) got in touch with a recruiter through my friend who was recruited by her. One technical interview on phone and then got invited to on campus interviews. It was a group event where bunch of candidates for summer internship got together. Had two technical interview and one q&a session. They treated us extremely well and I was very content with the process throughout']
[u'Initaially contacted via linkedin by a recruiter requesting permission to contact me in relation to a role. Followed by a telephone interview with the same recruiter. Then progressed onto a 2nd telephone interview with Hiring Manager based un US. Next step was to go into the linkedin office for an afternoon of interviews - met with the semior team manager and then 2 managers that the candidates would be working with on a day to day basis. The next portion of the interview were via video conference with staff in Californina - A 45 minute conversation with the hiring manager which included a working example of the role and how I would approach the issues faced within the role and the final part was a conversation with 2 existing business analyst from US team, his again included a presentation and working examples. Unfortunately I made it to the final round but was unsucessful in recieveing an offer.']
[u"A very structured and detailed interview, however the interviewer himself was arrogant and acted like he was doing me a favour. I get that LinkedIn are doing well, but having a superiority complex doesn't reflect well on the culture."]
[u'Received a phone call from LinkedIn recruiter few weeks after the online application. The recruiter was very friendly and engaging. Got an e-mail a week later from the recruiter saying another candidate was chosen. The entire process was very smooth and the recruiter was very professional.']
[u"Overall, the interview process was very good. They were open about expectations and flexible to move quickly or slowly. I had two phone interviews with 3 individuals from my department. Then an in-person interview where I had to present work and problem solve. The only odd part was that I didn't know exactly what position I was interviewing for. The reason for this was, they wanted to know my skill set and career goals in order to define a good fit."]
[u'I was contacted by a LinkedIn recruiter. She was very responsive over email. I then had a phone screen with an engineer. The phone screen did exactly what a phone screen should, it made sure I wasn\'t lying on my resume. The interviewer had me do some basic coding over collabnet. He also was very helpful in answering my questions about the company. Having passed the phone screen I went in for an in-person interview. It was an all day affair where I got there at 10 and was out by 5:30 or so. The day consisted of a series of 45 minute interviews with pairs of engineers and managers from various groups in the department for which I was interviewing. They have a well oiled interview machine going there. When I arrived they presented me with a loaner iPad which had my interview schedule, they gave me a tour of the campus, and when I got to the actual room where I was going to interview they had a number of goodies for me as gifts. Unlike companies such as Google, the interview questions were aimed at assessing my skills rather than establishing the interviewer\'s alpha-geek status. Many questions were challenging without being "gotcha" questions. They were the sort of questions that an experienced engineer should be able to answer.']
[u'phone interview: 1. experience introduction 2. coding question']
[u'Submitted resume online, Email from recruiter same day Phone screen with recruiter technical phone screen with online coding exercise with hiring manager a week later Another technical phone screen with an engineer in the group On site interviews - multiple engineers']
[u'There should be two rounds of phone interviews and one on-site interview. I applied for the position in LinkedIn career page. A recruiter contacted me the next day and scheduled my first phone screen. After the first phone screen, the recruiter contacted me regarding the next round of the phone screen.']
[u'Round 1: Skype/phone call and screenshare for programming task. Round 2: In-person interview and too much exhaustive 5 hours (includes whiteboard program tasks and repeated explanations to each interviewer was boring).']
[u'Overall, a pretty straightforward and enjoyable hiring/interview process. Phone interview (generally with your HR contact), followed by a "Batch Day" (superday) with several in-person, 1-on-1 interviews. Phone interview was very casual, entirely behavioral. In-person interviews were mostly behavioral and largely focused on getting a better sense of how you interact with people, what your take on sales is, why you\'re interested in working in sales and at LinkedIn, etc. One of your superday interviews will be a sample sales pitch/presentation where you role-ply as a LinkedIn salesperson pitching recruitment solutions to a potential client. 10min long, you\'re given materials beforehand to brief yourself on the project. Expectations aren\'t extremely high, just hit all the points -- find the pains, be courteous, bring up the best parts of the product as they pertain to the client\'s needs, etc. Received notification that I\'d been extended the offer within the week.']
[u"I was contacted by a LinkedIn HR rep a few weeks after submitting my resume at a conference. He was really enthusiastic and clearly loves his job, which initially peaked my interested in working for LinkedIn. I had one phone interview, which was pleasant and went well. About a week later I was invited to attend a Linkedin Invitational, which I gather is LinkedIn's new approach to the gruelling, all day long interview process. Basically, I arrived at the LinkedIn office, along with about fifteen other Software Engineering candidates (all new grads, like me), to participate in an all day long event which included not only four hour-long, one on one interviews (three technical, one management), but also included Q&A sessions with a group of recent hires, the director of Engineering and the CEO himself, as well as a campus tour, and a fancy dinner in San Francisco. LinkedIn put us up in a great hotel in downtown San Francisco that night, and I gladly took the opportunity to spend the rest of the night on the town with the other candidates (it was a Friday after all). Overall, the experience was overwhelmingly positive. How could I not want to work for LinkedIn after that? Especially after talking to so many current LinkedIn employees who clearly loved their jobs and were genuinely excited to talk to us candidates. If a company cares so much about treating not just their employees well, but even their candidates well, I think it bodes well for a future career with them. Anyways, a week later I was contacted by my HR rep again, this time to offer me a job with a very good salary and hefty relocation bonus, as well stock options, great benefits, free CalTrain pass, etc. It took all of about two seconds to decide I was going to take the job."]
[u'One behavior interview: Talk about yourself Two phone screen: Easy coding questions. You can find most of them on glassdoor or other interview question websites 5 round onsite interview: 1 behavior interview, 2 coding interviews (easy) and 2 design interviews (hard for me, I am not familiar with system design questions)']
[u"First applied in late May and was contacted through a recruiter early June for a phone interview. Had a bit of a time difference as they were calling from California and I'm three hours ahead. The recruiter basically asked me to go through my resume and tell them about my experiences. After that, I waited 2 extra days from what they told me was the expected date to hear back from them."]
[u'The interview process was easy, friendly, efficient and fast. It took 2 weeks between first phone conversations and the actual presentation via video call with the team in Dublin. All LinkedIn team involved were extremely helpful, proactive and reachable during the process.']
[u'Recruiter was awesome and had great communication. Did a phone screen with her and then moved on to two technical phone interviews. Both phone interviews are done in an IDE of your choice with someone watching your screen over skype. You\'re given 45 minutes to complete the problem and then allowed to wrap it up at home and submit it. Passed the first telephone screening but "failed" the second. When I asked why I failed, the recruiter sent me the engineer\'s responds with all of these problems with my code. Granted these problems were present in my first 45 minutes (because I was working through the problem) but my final solution had none of these problems. It was evident that the 2nd interviewer didn\'t even look at my final solution. He made his judgement off of what he saw on the phone an told me to submit a final answer anyways.']
[u'there were 3 telephonic rounds followed with face to face interview and presentation']
[u"The interview process was a nightmare. It was so bad that I never was given an offer nor sent a letter of regret. I had my initial phone screening set for a recruiter. After our first call was missed I justified it by the recruiter possibly being busy since there is likely a high supply of candidates. I sent a polite email and we rescheduled the call. I waited anxiously for the call to come in and the phone never rang. (Repeat 2x). Finally, after the FOURTH call was missed and I spent 8 hours of my life waiting around I called the recruiter. The screening process was not that difficult. It was more of a behavioral interview. Things went well so I was passed on to the Hiring Manager/2nd round interview. Unfortunately, I had a job that I need to keep so the Hiring Manager called me 45 minutes after the scheduled time for our 30 minute interview and I was already driving to work. The hiring manager didn't seem apologetic for being so late and asked if we could have an interview 15 minutes later which was an hour after the interview was scheduled. After I got home I sent an email explaining why I was unable to respond and requesting another interview. The manager never replied and I was told by the recruiter I would be a better fit for a different role. After that no further communication happened even though I followed up shortly afterward."]
[u'The hiring process was pretty standard - phone screen following by phone technical, etc. The technical was awful. I ended up getting all their questions correct, but they stressed efficiency so much that I had to make my code significantly more complicated just to satisify them. I personally think this is a terrible mentality and that other factors such as code readability/maintainability are with a marginal sacrifice in performance.']
[u"A recruiter contacted me regarding a position I applied for on the East Coast. Had a good chat, relatively quick but straight forward HR questions. The interviewer had originally said 20 minutes but I think it probably ended at the 12 minute mark. First interview - a breeze, but just because it was the initial interview. That's as far as it went."]
[u'LinkedIn has a very unprofessional and unorganized interview process with an HR department that seems to not care. Late for phone interviews, zero interest in candidates, and a self importance of a company that has \u201cmade it\u201d. I think this comes from being located next to Google in Mountain View so they think they\u2019re one of big guys too. Sorry to say, you\u2019re not even close LinkedIn. Can you say myspace? Get over yourselves.']
[u'Had the initial phone interview, followed by two technical phone interviews. I passed both, and was then brought in for the on site interview. They are very open about their hiring process, and generally very friendly.']
[u'Applied for the position through LinkedIn and received an email for an initial phone screening. Had three 45-minute technical interviews afterwards, with the last two being back to back. Received phone call about result within 5 days. HR was the same person that whole time and was extremely friendly, respectful, and responsive.']
[u"I applied the Software Engineer for new Grad, they response me at the same day as my application, that's very fast. We schedule the first phone interview about the backgound and set the technical interview. The process is not hard, the recuiter is nice. I will update it after I finish it."]
[u'LinkedIn recruiter called me and it was more of HR round getting know about me and detail description about position. First technical interview followed after 2 days which had normal questions like Features of HTML 5, difference between css ID and class. Javascript framework (Jquery)']
[u'I was initially approached by a recruiter through an internal connection. There were four separate interviews, I am located in Canada, so all interviews for this position were done over the phone. The first interview was mostly HR questions, basically to get an idea of my personality. In the second interview I was asked technical questions regarding my knowledge of Javascript, CSS, and HTML, questions were fairly straightforward. The third interview was done with an on-line collaborative coding tool, I was asked to implement some algorithms in Javascript as well as create some functional CSS elements. The fourth interview was coding again, but a little more in-depth with Javascript (Object-oriented code, functional programming). All in all the process was very pleasant, the interviewers were all very attentive and helpful in answering questions, and recruiters were very prompt delivering their feedback.']
[u'The interview processes consisted on a phone screen and then interviews. The phone screen went well - pretty standard. The actual interviews consisted on some behavioral questions first, and the went on into mini-case questions.']
[u"The process started with On Campus interviews at my school. I'm not sure how else one could apply for this position, as I couldn't find it on their website. They reached out to me after I RSVP'd through my career services center at my university. On campus interviews were fun and informative-- met with three different people. A week later I was invited up to the SF offices for a full day of interviews at what they call the LinkedIn Invitational for College Grads-to-Be. They flew us up and hosted us overnight in a lovely hotel. The day of interviews was intense, but fun. The other candidates were from all over and incredibly sharp. I was in good company. We had an introduction, a tour, four rounds of interviews and a networking luncheon. A week later, I received the offer. Overall, I was very impressed with the recruiting process."]
[u'1 high level phone screen -- covering a range of front end topics. Accessibility, the box model, app performance, etc. 2 technical phone screens (using collabedit), one covering CSS specificity and closures, the other to build a small widget from the web app 5 hours of on site technical coding interviews (~1 hr per person). Problems covered implementing common functions, extending prototypes, recursing the DOM tree, CSS edge cases, also implementing a section of the live site. Culture seemed pretty good. However, prepare to be a cog in the 80+ web developer machine.']
[u'Interview process consisted of phone screen with an recruter and then in-house invitational. The in-house invitational was a great experience that consiste of four interviews all about 30 minutes long. The interviews were very straight forward. The first two were more fit based and the last two interviews were more hypothetical and thinking based questions.']
[u'Make sure to have researched what Ad Ops (or your respective position) is all about. And get a sense for what the LinkedIn culture is like.. The entire process took a little over a month. First interview was really laid back (on phone) with a campus recruiter (I got the interview through applying online//referral). She was very nice and told me where we would go from there. It was just a general screening. 2nd interview a week later (on phone) with someone from the Ad Ops department. Again, pretty standard, I talked about some projects I had worked on in school. Gave examples of what was frustrating with the project and how I overcame it. She was also very nice just like everyone else. 3rd interview was with three "higher up" people in the Ad Ops department via skype. It was one at a time, 20 minutes each. I walked them through my resume, told them why I was interested in linkedin and the position itself and so on. They also asked where I see myself in the future, and about projects in school. Not any behavioral questions at all. I was supposed to get a decision after that but it seemed they had a hard time narrowing it down to the final candidate. So they scheduled one last (a fourth) interview with me with yet another on-phone interview. I feel I did well in this interview, same as the rest. I emphasized my working-in-a-team experiences.']
[u'Contacted by HR, followed by a second phone screen. After that, they flew me out to the headquarters in Mountain View for a full technical interview. Asked me questions about Javascript, a lot of the tricky end cases and nuances of CSS and in depth HTML structuring.']
[u'Contacted by a hr recruiter and followed by two phone interviews.']
[u"I was contacted by a recruiter who saw my profile on LinkedIn. The first interview was a short ~30-minute phone screen. The recruiter was nice, but he asked technical questions but was obviously reading from a script and couldn't clarify the questions when they were unclear. So if he asked a question and I didn't understand what he was asking for, he just wrote down that I didn't know and moved on to something else. I think this cost me the job."]
[u"Had an initial phone interview with a recruiter going over the company and position and a small handful of easy technical questions. Second interview was also over the phone with two engineers and was very technical. Covered some lower level Linux and monitoring. Was pretty nervous during second interview and bonked on some of the questions. Overall it was a positive experience, the recruiter got back to me the day after my initial technical interview to let me know I would not be moving on which I appreciate not sitting around or having to bug them for a 'no'."]
[u'A recruiter responds to my application by emailing to setup a phone interview. After playing phone tag a couple times to setup the time, we finally settled for a Saturday interview which worked fine. After waiting for about 15 minutes by the phone, no phone call. I emailed her right away and she replies the following Monday apologizing that she double booked. Ok no problem, so we rescheduled on a weekday. Day of, I am left waiting for a good 20-25 minutes and the phone finally rings. She apologizes that she\'s late, etc. etc. and we went on with the interview. I thought it went really well. We ended with her promising that she\'ll get in touch with me the following day as "she believes in full transparency and disclosure and does not want people to be left in the dark", and she walks me through the next steps. A month and a half later, and a couple of follow ups, I have not heard back from her again. RECRUITERS: As much as people do want to work at LinkedIn, please be respectful of our time, especially since some people, like myself, are employed and are taking our current employer\'s time to sit around and wait for you to get yourselves organized. And please do not make any promises you do not or are not capable of keeping. I think LinkedIn is still a great product/service. I just wish recruiters are more aware and respectful of candidates\' time and expectations.']
[u'Was asked to prepare a sales presentation; even though I have 20+ years of sales experience. There were supposed to be three people interviewing me (in a panel) and on day of interview I was not asked to present and the other panel interviewers did not attend. Horrible interviewer... clearly very inexperienced manager.']
[u'Found and applied for the job through LinkedIn. Received an email that day to setup a phone interview. The recruiter called at the scheduled time and was very pleasant and easy to talk to. She asked normal phone interview questions like why do you want to work here, what attracted you to the role etc. She gave me feedback immediately that I was through to a face to face interview and would be in touch to schedule a time. The interview was then setup for the following week. Because this was a brand new role there was just one interviewer who would be the direct manager and it was quite informal.']
[u'I was called by the internal recruiter. The initial HR call was very pleasant and courteous. She set up a phone technical interview with two interviewers. One was the lead and the second was the follower. I had to log on to CollabEdit which allows you to write code in an editor.']
[u"I skipped the phone interview since I had an employee's referral and went straight for the technical onsite interviews. There were five 1-hour long back-to-back technical rounds. The first round was a general design round with the hiring manager. He asked me some high level architecture questions, how to implement a REST API, etc. which were pretty basic. After that there were 3 coding interviews with a panel of 2 engineers in each round. My problem was that after giving you the initial question the interviewers gave me no time to think. Every time you pause to think your general solution or if you try coming up with a better approach they keep asking you more questions. Two of those interviews seemed to be interviewing the first time and almost seemed to have an agenda to put me down so he/she could look good to someone else. The questions weren't hard at all and in fact I ended up giving optimized solutions O(n) instead of standard brute-force solutions O(n^2). I felt like two of the six engineers themselves didn't quite understand why the solutions were better and ultimately although I nailed 2 of the 3 interviews I ended up not getting an offer. I guess I feel let down by the interview process cause although I took some more time, I ended up arriving at optimal solutions on 2 of the 3 coding challenges. I could have just gone for the simple, boring and brute-force solution but instead I tried to do better and they didn't seem to care or notice. The last round was on design and architecture by a senior engineer and I really enjoyed that interview. It was open ended and challenging enough and the interviewer seemed to know what he was doing as we dug deeper and deeper into the details."]
[u'Phone Screen']
[u'Screen call by Talent Manager in AU followed by interview with Talent Manager of APAC. Initially interviewed for a Corporate Sales Manager role however they felt I do not have the necessary skills yet to be on that level but Talent Manager liked my enthusiasm for the organization and recommended me for the Sales Development Specialist role. Web-call with hiring manager - Head of BD in AU at their office in Singapore. Rejected once and I wrote in explaining I had the exact same background as the 2 SDS sitting in Singapore and agreed to meet me when she\'s in Singapore. Met her again in Singapore and finalized interview and selection process. For an organization that is all about talent & efficiency in sourcing talent, LinkedIn talent takes a very long time in getting good feedback and interview response. I am sorry but a mere "we found someone else that has a better fit for the role" is not going to cut, a great Talent Manager should be able to give real time feedback in helping the candidate improve and better her performance in her next interview. I had come in for a great experience by LinkedIn in terms of talent acquisition however they seems to be very slow and ineffective in their response. And in the midst of the interviews the Talent Manager was transferred to the UK & there were no formal introduction to the new Manager - I only learnt all this via her auto reply. Again not in favor of LinkedIn. For all the emails I sent to follow up, I had to sent them twice (in a spread of 4-5 days) before getting a response - this is consistent through out. It was a rejection that was very hard for me to accept because there were 2 SDS in Singapore and they were from the same background as I was, if not with lesser experience than I had. I came in with such great enthusiasm for the culture and brand of LinkedIn that it was unfortunate the Hiring Manager could not see that because I really could not foresee anyone who has more experience than me applying for a entry level sales role because he or she would then be over qualified for the role. I had a theory it was due to her not liking enthusiastic sales people or due to my ethnicity as her team were mostly of the same race as she was. I had even done background checks on the 2 SDS as they were working in my previous company and I had gotten feedback from their Sales Directors and they were not that great sales people - looking at numbers and targets achieved. So it really isn\'t about your sales skill and talent at LinkedIn - based on my experience.']
[u'A little long, they pulled the good cop/bad cop routine.']
[u'very organised, HR and hiring managers were all very professional and friendly. They are all very helpful in sharing their linkedin experience and can tell they are very proud of the company and the opportunity to work with them.']
[u'3 phone calls (1 HR, 2 Product Managers) + Flight to Mountain View for a day of interviews with 5 other Product Managers. The HR team was extremely friendly but during my time on campus, I could tell they were exhausted and not happy. Some of the PMs were very awesome and were quite brilliant, but one team in particular were quite negative and gave me a total bad experience. One of the PMs was also quite unprofessional (she was junior) and honestly felt like leaving the office after some of her questions were insulting.']
[u'I went through a process of 4 Phone Interviews. The first was from a recruiter and was pretty straightforward. The others were much more difficult, but all of the interviewers were cordial and professional. They were prompt about letting me know when I was eliminated from consideration, which I appreciated, though the process seemed to drag out longer than it should have.']
[u'I went to an info session on campus and applied online, then was contacted by a recruiter for a phone screen. The phone screen was pretty basic and short, only about twenty minutes. The recruiter was really nice and asked me about a time when I acted as a leader, if I had any experience working with a quota, and of course why I wanted to work at LinkedIn. He gave me time to ask him questions about the position, and then invited me to their Invitational in San Francisco the following week. At the Invitational there were about seven other candidates. We got a chance to ask one of the team managers our questions about the company and about the position, and then we got a tour of the office and lunch. At lunch they brought in a bunch of other SDSs for us to talk to. They were all very nice, friendly and open to answering questions. We then went off to our four, 30-minute interviews. Again, the questions were pretty standard; be prepared to talk about why you want to work at LinkedIn, why you want to work in sales, your teamwork experience, leadership experience, and what sets you apart as a candidate. Know the product pretty well, too. I walked out feeling pretty good about it, and was contacted by my recruiter with an offer the next day. Overall, it was a great experience! Everyone was extremely friendly, outgoing, and intelligent; they obviously loved the company and had great experiences to share. Just relax, be yourself, and ask a lot of questions. :)']
[u'I interviewed with a total of 6 people, including a co-founder. My first interview I was asked to take a feature and make it easier to use. I was also asked about user growth strategies. My other 5 interviews were at HQ, all in one day. The questions were mostly oriented around design and user experience.']
[u'After submitting my application online I received a call from a recruiter to set up a screening call. The screening call was fairly basic with general questions about why I wanted to join LinkedIn, my relevant experience, any awards I had achieved in previous jobs, my greatest achievement... etc. After I was invited into the offices to meet with a team leader and two potential colleagues as well as a language test (it\'s a multilingual position). Everyone was very friendly and there were no questions out of the ordinary: why LinkedIn? How does LinkedIn earn money? What three words would your colleagues describe you with? What are your weaknesses? What is good customer service? What is bad customer service? etc. I was then invited to the offices a second time to meet with the manager who asked me questions about my background, skills, strengths, weaknesses... etc. Finally, I had a final phone interview with the global manager going through most of the same questions. All-in-all it was a relatively easy, although slightly long, interview process with most of the questions being fairly standard. I have been interviewing with other well-known internet companies as well and I think that the interview process was more straightforward. While I would advise spending a while getting to know the product company, how they earn their revenue and the role, there are no questions requiring in-depth knowledge about the company nor tricky questions (of the "How many cows are there in Ireland?" type). As for the offices and staff: everyone was really friendly and it looks like a great place to work! Having received an offer I\'m very happy with the salary and benefits.']
[u"Applied through LinkedIn (obvious choice) and was contacted within 2 weeks. Recruiter was friendly and helpful, and hooked me up with one of the technical staff for a phone/collabedit interview. Questions were easy, but I wasn't prepared."]
[u'ask questions about sql and data mining']
[u'Very efficient process: 1. Initial interview with Head of Sales 2. Interview with a senior executive from account services and HR 3. Sales role play interview with HR rep, head of sales, head of account services, team member from Sales Solutions The sales role play is very corporate and feels contrived. Found it hard to stick with it, in the end I wanted it over and missed a couple of big opportunities to demonstrate my sales skills.']
[u"Applied online through LinkedIn website. I reached out to the recruiter who posted the job- I think this is what put myself on their map 15-20 minute phone interview, very standard, what are you passionate about, why LinkedIn, why are you looking to move etc. At the end, it went well and I was invited to LinkedIn SF to interview there. They were straight up about the job and the pay- Pay is around 40K, you could make 50 if you really excelled. Here's the catch- 2 years ago, they implemented a new program for sales development where you are actually a recruiter for Linkedin for the first 3-4 months on the job. You are calling people to have them come work at LinkedIn. Yes, you gain familiarity with the platform and recruiting (which is LI's bread and butter) but still, not a lot of fun Anyway, went up to SF to interview. Welcomed, was there with 6 other candidates, we received t shirts, giveaways etc. We heard about the company and spoke to 3 recruiters, then had a nice lunch and got a comprehensive tour of the offices- very corporate but also modern with the silicon valley touch. Keep in mind you would start in Sunnyvale or Mt. View, not SF- which isn't too great. Regardless, after lunch, 4 separate interviews with sales development team leads/managers , each about 30 mins. Very standard- why linkedin, tell me about yourself. Everyone was very nice. Make sure you can distinguish yourself (your prop, what you can bring to LI). Know the platform through and through. Had to hound the recruiter for a week to hear back. Did not receive an offer. I may have been overqualified- the role really is just cold calling people as a recruiter"]
[u'Recruiter sent an inMail via Linkedin to me multiple times through a period of 8 months. i finally gave in and decided to take a phone screen, it was purely waste of my time. I took two 1hr phone screens with two different persons. First round was in depth discussion about my present company and my work at my previous company and such. Second screen was rather technical but its very easy, it was mostly syadministration stuff about kickstart, configuration management etc. I personally didnt felt there\'s a strong sense or interest for a good technical screen. Interviewer tells me he really enjoyed the conversation, would like to meet me in person and i should expect to hear from recruiter/staffing for onsite soon. After waiting for two more days i sent a follow-up email to recruiter asking for feedback and left a vm, but there\'s no response for another week. I followed up after another week then recruiter mails me "she\'s sorry that i havent received(?) the email sent to me on the interview day that, team\'d like to pass". Irony is that this a template sent at 4:00pm where as the second screen lasted till 5:34pm that day. Seriously ??? I\'ve have personally known people who moved to Linkedin from my previous company and shared this feedback, the response i heard was the interview process could be a sham to meet the hr quota and someone could\'ve handpicked for the position. My contact shared feedback that bureaucracy and back-filling is much rampant at Linkedin even though it\'s relatively younger and small.']
[u'Got first phone interview with HR. Asked me about my background and my preferences. Got second interview with senior architect.']
[u'One phone interview, and full day of final round interviews']
[u"I had two phone interviews and SIX back to back onsite interviews. The second phone interviewer did not call at the assigned time, I had to track the recruiter - when they finally tracked the guy down, they arranged for another call. The interviewer was clearly frazzled and had no idea how to frame questions - he got lost explaining the question itself!! Anyways, I aced both phone interviews and go invited to on-site and they scheduled me with the same guy for the first interview. Guess what? He doesn't show up, AGAIN! I sit in the room with my 'oh so cool iPad' waiting, then finally he shows up 45 minutes late and they made him come back again after my last interview. Total 6 on-site interviews with coding and design questions. The design interviewers weren't really sure on what they were looking for - they didn't even know how to explain the question well or how to probe deeper. After all six interviews (majority of which ended up in the interviewer clearly impressed and one even saying 'hope to see around here soon'. I got a small tour of the company by the recruiter. The next day recruiter calls me and says that they were very impressed with my interview feedback and wanted to see where I fit and he wil call back and arrange a phone call with a hiring manager and then prepare an offer. Few hours later the recruiter calls back and tells me that none of the hiring managers found me to be a good fit so they are not proceeding an offer at this time and gave some vague assurances that they will keep looking for a fit (wth?!) I found the whole interview process totally BACKWARDS. Why would you put a candidate through EIGHT HOURS of interviewing - not to mention waste his entire day and energy - and then have all your interviewers give positive feedback AND THEN find out if he is a good fit or not. In any mature stable company, that kind of stuff is cleared out BEFORE the first phone interview or DURING the phone interviews or DURING the on-site interviews. Not AFTER the whole process."]
[u'I got an email after 2 weeks of online application for screening interview from HR. HR people are nice they ask some behavioral question based on our past work experience and ask about our field of interest in which I want to work. After that HR describes about various team working there they want to map you with the team in which you most interest. This phone interview took around 12 min.']
[u'Referral - Phone Screen - Face to Face - Phone Call']
[u'The process was super-fast, they contacted me a week after I submit my resume online. I was contacted by a research scientist at data analytics group and after he talked about my research a bit, he asked me some machine learning background questions like SVM algorithm and kernels. Then he approached to programming questions, like how you write a code to store a large matrix. The programming part was easy but you need to refresh your machine learning background a little bit.']
[u'Initial email contact, which lead to a technical phone interview.']
[u'A recruiter called me in late October and said he wanted to have an interview with me for a Talent Manager role. In november I had the first interview with a new HR-person that said she never have had so much to do anywhere before!! The interview went smooth. In december I had an interview via Skype with a very stressed marketing manager. She was very nice but seemed to be very stressed too. I really like the product they have so I decided to go further on if they wanted to. And so they did. I got a F2F interview with the Sales Manager which was too very stressed since it was Q4. During the interview he was typing on his computer and had to go out of the room once to take a call (the 2nd call he took in the room).']
[u'4 rounds of interviews including a first screening by a recruiter, then 2 rounds of technical interviews and a last "batch day" onsite round. The screening round was done by a recruiter who asked generally about skills and general understanding of the business of the company. The recruiter was friendly and knowledgable and told me on the spot that she was going to put me through. The 2nd round was a conceptual technical interview, asking about how you would solve certain HTML/CSS problems. The 3rd round was a technical interview done online through a code sharing platform. I was asked to write some HTML, CSS and javascript. Nothing too complicated. Both these two rounds were done by actual web developers--they were a little awkward, apologetic even but generally friendly and helpful in the process. The last round was an onsite round where they flew me out to their main campus in Mountain View. There were 4 interviews in total, 3 of which were technical and one was with a director to get my general understanding of the company. The other three interviewers were positive and helped me along the interview if I ran into problems. Just talking with them gave me great insight into the culture and the passion that the developers had for working at LinkedIn. Overall a great process.']
[u'I was contacted by a recruiter after a career fair at my university, had a brief 10 minute phone call with the recruiter the following week. She set me up with an on-campus interview for about 2 weeks after the initial phone call.']
[u'Sent my CV through their web site. Got a reply a few days later and after a short HR interview they scheduled the first tech phone interview for the next week. I did quite well in the first interview and they scheduled a second phone interview. This time I could barely hear my two interviews and had a HARD time to understand the questions and the feedback. I took around 40 minutes to solve the first question and the solution was quite good. Then I had 20 min to solve the next question. I did it but there was a bug and I could not fix it. 2 days later they told me there was no strong fit and that was the end of the line for me.']
[u'Applied online and was contacted by a recruiter a couple weeks after. Had 3 technical phone interviews in all - first one was just one interview, second round was two back to back with two different teams. About a week after my second round interviews they extended me an offer. HR was in general very friendly; my recruiter was awesome.']
[u"I was referred to the recruiters through a current employee. I was contacted within a week by a recruiter who did an initial phone screen. I went through three more interviews. Everyone was very approachable but clearly took their jobs very seriously; showing interest in the company's culture and values and belief in the company's products is a must."]
[u'Linkedin contacted me several times about openings within organization but the timing was never right for me. At the end of last year, I reached out to them and they put me through the process. I had several phone interviews and asked to share a presentation.']
[u'Had four interviews. Process was disorganized and went for weeks without hearing from members of the team.']
[u"Contacted on LinkedIn by a recruiter. After an initial chat with the recruiter, he offered some teams of interest. Then two phone screens. First phone screen was around Java specific questions and coding for multhreaded datastructure . Second phone screen asked me to create a minimal spanning tree. Easy enough. I got the reply back in 4 days. Then they setup the onsite. I was flown in to Mountain view. They took care of flight, car rental and hotel expenses. The onsite consisted of 5 interviews and a tour at the end. The onsite question were considerably more difficult. Each interview had a shadow interviewer so that made things more stressful. Two interviews were deep dives into projects on my resume. They wanted to know each and every detail including why I made certain decisions, what were the tradeoffs, what were the most difficult bugs, what mistakes I made and more technical details. One interview was on system design where they asked me to implement my own web crawler system. Again very technical and deep. I didn't know much about search systems so didn't do very well here. Two interviews focused on coding. First was a Dynamic programming question that I had not seen before. Required a bit of help to realize that it was a DP. Was able to write code after I realized the approach. Second coding question was to find the longest arithmetic progression in an array of integers. This was easy. Got an offer after one week. The offer was decent. I spoke to some friends of friends working at linkedin and got a sense that it was not a healthy work environment and they weren't very happy. The office space was crowded beyond what it could hold and the environment just didn't seem like a place where I could do my best work."]
[u"LinkedIn Recruiter got in touch with me via LinkedIn. Initial phone interview for culture fit, second was phone interview with discussion about my technical background, third was a technical/coding phone interview. Haven't heard back."]
[u'Had 2 phone interviews and 6 in-person interviews. Long, drawn out process that was extremely time consuming. No follow up from HR/Recruiter after weeks of interviewing- took some time to pull an answer out from them. Met a handful of marketing team members during the interviews. Some of the more senior managers were cocky and acted like they were doing me a favor to spend the time interviewing. Other team members were pleasant. Was never offered water or a break for a 6 hour back-to-back, packed interview.']
[u'Called me and asked me a few technical questions. Lots of big O questions. Was asked to code an algorithm to find if there exists 2 numbers in an array that sum up to a specific "s" and then find the big O of this. Got it right but they never responded after my interview because they filled up all their positions just before (but the interviewer was unaware of this).']
[u"I was emailed 3 months after I had submitted my resume and cover letter. A phone interview was scheduled for a week later and after a 25 minute call, I was invited to an onsite in SF. This is where the disaster began. The night before my onsite, I was cancelled on. The next morning, the recruiter calls me and asks me to come into the office. Very apologetic, but a horrible way to accomodate candidates. This was followed up with one Skype interview. A week after that, I was extended an offer. Overall, the recruiting team's scheduling of my interviews was not a smooth experience."]
[u'Phone Screen #1, Phone Interview #1, Corp Preso via WebEx, In-person interview #1, In-person Interview #2, Offer']
[u'The interview process was probably the most enlightening interview process I had out of all of the jobs I applied for. It started out by being contacted by a recruiter several months back. At the time I was not looking for a position. Well that changed a month or two later. First I talked to a recruiter. Shortly after that I had a technical phone screening, where they probed for my understanding of javascript, html, and css. You should understand what makes these things powerful and also understand their shortcomings. After that I had 2 more interviews where I did some live coding where you have to replicate the functionality of a given design. Decided to write one using just Javascript and the other with jQuery to save time. After that I was asked to come do an onsite interview. A lot more of the same stuff but way more in depth. Get comfortable with white boarding problems! Knowing how a browser works may help you. Anyways, a week and half later I got an offer. Yay!']
[u'Two technical interviews']
[u'The HR person was quite friendly and contacted me almost immediately. They set up my technical phone screens and then she followed up quickly after them, moving me to the next round. After the next round of technical phone screens, she emailed me often asking when she could call, but "forgot" to call me for weeks. I was quite annoyed, but I let it go on. Overall, the experience started off well but got steadily worse.']

Great overall experience. Everyone I met with encouraged me to reach out for advice and tips on how to be successful in the process. With a couple offers on the table, it was this willingness to help and overall feeling of them wanting me to be successful that made me decide LinkedIn was the right choice for me."]

[u'Contacted by recruiter via LinkedIn, In mail. Set it up a phone interview with the recruiter answered some general questions. Then had a 45 mins tech phone interview. coding on a notepad']
[u"Contacted by a recruiter who found my resume online. Was scheduled to have two phone interviews: first an exploratory one, second a coding interview. In the exploratory interview, I was asked a bit about my PhD research. We then proceeded to have an open-ended discussion about machine learning/data mining challenges in designing the LinkedIn job search engine. It started off by asking how I would try to achieve some simple piece of functionality; then I was asked to identify where my approach would fail; then I was asked whether I could see how to improve the approach under more assumptions, and so on. Overall my feeling was that the interviewer was trying to gauge my grasp of when/where/how to apply ML/data mining techniques, and to test my thought process. In the coding interview, I was asked to design and code up achieve a (conceptually) simple piece of functionality for user search logs. I was not entirely successful with the implementation, as there proved to be more cases to consider than I had initially thought, and I don't think my final solution was optimally efficient. But I did think out loud throughout the process, and I think the interviewer took that into consideration when assessing me. The interviewer was not strict about me using any particular language, and I think I ended up using pseudocode."]
[u"The hiring process with LinkedIn was very professional. It was very similar to interviews done by Google and other large companies. There was a pair of participants which sometimes added a bit of chaos, and was slightly unnerving. Overall I got the feeling LinkedIn was ramping up the quality of the developers it was looking for. I'm not sure how many false negatives they see, but it likely will be a good idea to really ensure you are on the strongly desired side of things."]
[u'A recruiter collects the personal information first and then setup a technical phone-screen interview.']
[u'I was initially contacted by a manager on LinkedIn about my potential interest in a contractor position at LinkedIn. Passing my info to a recruiter, I had several brief conversations with the recruiter to assess fit and background, at which point I had a technical phone interview with a LinkedIn engineer which included live coding on a website. I did not perform particularly well on the technical phone interview, but never contacted by the recruiter to notify me that I was no longer being considered for the position.']
[u'Took almost 2 months when all was said and done because they were trying to figure out their headcount, but they were very good at keeping me in the loop. Once I got the offer everything moved very quickly.']
[u'The recruiter sent me an email asking my suitables dates and times to call me, I receive the call at the time and date expected. (Not very professional, a lot of people laughing in the background..) Questions: Why linkedin? How does linkedin make money? Examples of bad customer service experience Examples of good customer service experience - Which awards did you get as an employee - How many languages I speak She told me that they were looking for a Italian Speaker, but from the beginning she knew I didn\xb4t speak Italian fluent, however if she would have a position for me she will contact to me again.']
[u'Pleasant experience overall. Recruiters were very pleasant to work with, i had a phone screen with the recruiter followed by a couple of conversations with employees and finally an onsite interview with 3 people.']
[u'first interview (phone) was with HR recruiter, who took me through the company in detail, the role and asked questions on motivations to move, my current experience, challenges I have experienced, what I most and least like about my job. Then I went on to have phone interview with hiring manager, where I was explained in detail the day to day of the job, the software tools used, the process from data to insights, the influence the role can have on current customers, how the team and company is growing. Overall a very good experience, however I did not progress from here, I am happy to have learnt a lot about myself and the process that LinkedIn uses to hire their future staff.']
[u'I had a phone screen then was brought back twice to interview with 3 different people each time. The questions were not too bad and I prepared myself properly.']
[u"Campus recruiting. two rounds of phone interviews. both are for an hour. first go through your resume for like 10 - 15 minutes. then given you one to two algorithm questions. then onsite, there will be 4 rounds of interview. two of them is about algorithm which you need to write code, and one is about system design, and one is kinda like behaviour interview. sometimes, you get two rounds of system design interviews. basically that's it. Linkedin's kinda easy comparing to other companies, and they are hiring a lot of people. good luck!"]
[u'I had a referral and went through five interviews in total, over the phone, videoconference and in person. The interviews themselves were interesting, nothing too unusual. The recruiter could have communicated more effectively. On more than one occasion I was told that I would have an answer in two days but heard nothing for a week.']
[u'1st round f2f interview with a product manager']
[u'I was contacted by recruiter after their campus visit. I had two phone interviews and 6 interviews when on-site. The phone interviews are not difficult at all. The on-site interviews are a bit tough in term of the number of interviews. There are 2 design questions and 3 algorithms questions, and one manager interview, discussing technical stuff.']
[u'Very average interview questions which lasted for about 2 hours and a half. Asked question On past experiences and very scenario based questions. Recruiter was very prompt on getting back with an answer as I had a tight dead line. Overall a pleasant experience to interview with the recruiting team at LinkedIn.']
[u'** Phone Interview (1 hour) Simple coding questions and Object oriented questions. ** Onsite Interview (6.5 hours) 2x simple coding interviews, 1x design architecture interview, 1x interview with higher up management + lunch, 1x HR. I would not recommend people to apply or work at this company because management issues can be seen even during the interview process: 1) Each interview you get a senior interviewer and a junior interviewer, during the interview I can see the junior interviewer trying to please the senior interviewer and get attention from the senior interviewer. 2) Higher management guy I met with did not have fond words to say about LinkedIn. When we had lunch, we bumped into a lot of people but no one greeted him. I did not get a feeling that higher management is very liked/approachable by others in the company.']
[u"Very smooth, best interview process I've gone through. One phone interview, then onsite interviews. Very Professional HR."]
[u'Everyone was very professional and each had 30 minutes to ask questions. Overall the transition from interviewer to the next was smooth. I can tell they were trying hard to find the best candidates for the opening despite busy schedules. The job require interviewing with 4/5 people. Most questions are about experience and a few are consulting/IQ questions.']
[u'Referred by a friend. After talking with recruiter, a phone screen is scheduled. Two LinkedIn engineers interviewed me together. The call quality was bad but the interviewer were patient. I was asked to code on CollabEdit. Only one question was asked. I figured out most of the algorithm but stumbled on the implementation the Iterator interface in such a scenario.']
[u'Handed my resume at the school career fair. My first interview was a phone interview with HR, lasting about 30 mins. They asked about my interests, etc. The second interview was a one hour phone interview. They started by asking questions about the resume, background, etc. Then they asked me to implement a concurrent read-write buffer.']
[u'LinkedIn fast-tracked my interview process, but they managed to set up a series of interviews with the wrong people (their applications team, rather than the data team). Each interviewer separately came to the conclusion in the course of the interview that I should have been interviewing with the other team. There were five interviews throughout the day, all an hour each, all but one of which consisted of two interviewers each (a junior interviewer, who was "in training" as an interviewer, and a senior interviewer). Each interview had a different purpose: there was an interview with a manager to see about team fit, a "big-picture" design / software architecture interview, two coding interviews etc. I had just recently interviewed with Google, and was surprised to find that the technical competence of interviewers at LinkedIn was significantly lower than that of interviewers at Google. (This might have just been the people assigned to interview me, I don\'t know.) It was clear that at least half the interviewers who were asking technical questions came completely unprepared to understand some of the theoretical issues behind the questions -- one interviewer argued for 10 minutes with me about the properties of minimal spanning trees, which she clearly did not understand. When right off the bat I outlined the algorithm with optimal complexity, she spent 10 minutes debating with me whether the solution would even work, and her questions made it really clear that she didn\'t have basic intuition of graph theory, or understand how or why Prim\'s algorithm worked. She wasn\'t satisfied until I described a much more straightforward but less efficient algorithm. She also spent a couple of minutes going back and forth with her co-interviewer when they came in, while looking at a laptop screen trying to decide which question on a company-internal list of questions they should ask me: they hadn\'t even picked a question, much less thought through it. (A later interview, when they tacked on interviews with a couple of people in the data team, was in fact very technically challenging, and required a good understanding of Bayesian networks, which I didn\'t brush up on before the interview and therefore bombed.) I will say that overall the interview process at LinkedIn was much better structured and better organized than the process at Google. Also, repeatedly I heard from LinkedIn employees that the thing they liked about working there was that it was still a small, nimble company, meaning they could innovate fast, they owned their work, and they had access to pretty much anyone in the company. However, personally Google feels like a better cultural fit for me than LinkedIn. It took LinkedIn forever to get back to me with an answer (3 weeks?), in spite of the fact I had a major visa issue and had made it clear multiple times that I needed an answer quickly.']
[u'First there will be a phone talk by the HR personnel detailing the role and then its a nice lil pep talk and casual questions on what you are looking for, why you planning for a change blah blah.. Couple of days later, time gets scheduled for the actual technical interview... If you clear the phone interview, you get called onsite for the more in depth interview process.']
[u'I was contacted for an interview through my campus. I talked with the recruiter and he made the position seem very enticing and we scheduled a technical phone interview. I had to keep rescheduling the interview since the interviewer kept missing our scheduled time, Eventually, we talked and he asked me to code up an RPN calculator through collabedit. I did pretty well and was contacted for a second phone screen. I felt this interview went pretty well too but was told after that I would not be moving on. The interviewer called slightly late and left early saying he had a meeting. Overall, I would suggest to LinkedIn to give a little more respect to candidates who are interviewing and be generally faster with response times (was told more than 2 weeks after the phone interview that I would not be moving on).']
[u'at career fair, one of the engineer was interested in my experience and got invited to dinner with about 10 other students. Then after two weeks, a recruiter reached out to ask my preference for programming language and what other companies I was talking with.']
[u'First phone call was a phone screen. Second phone call was a technical interview, while coding on a shared document. The phone screen was basic questions asking you what team you want to work on, and that will match you up with your interviewer. I picked applications. The interview question was "Write a function to determine if a string is an integer."']
[u'Contacted through school system; interviewed through school system']
[u"I applied through my university's online job search program. A few weeks later I got contacted by a recruiter. We chatted on the phone to see if the position was what I was looking for, and we set up a technical phone interview for the next week. The actual interviewer was late since their interview room was double-booked. The interviewer was very difficult to understand over the phone since they were using speaker (there were two people on their end) and the room they were in was very echo-y. The interview was a very typical technical SE interview. Two weeks after the interview I still hadn't heard anything from LinkedIn and I had two offers that I'd prefer anyway on the table so I accepted one of those and let LinkedIn know. Apparently the lack of information is somewhat common -- I know two other people who had to contact LinkedIn asking if they had a decision and the next day progress was made. So if you're waiting, give them a nudge and see if they response, I suppose."]
[u'I applied to a Senior Product Manager role at Linkedin through Linkedin. Two weeks later, I was reached by a recruiter who introduced herself as a lead talent manager. We agreed on a time and date for a phone interview. I booked a room in my current company on a floor that no one knoes me etc, to ensure the proper environment. 5 minutes past the time that we had agreed, I received an email apologizing that the recruiter had a last minute meeting that she could not skip. OK, no problem. We agreed on another date and time for the following week. I booked a room at work. 15 minutes past the time, no call from Linkedin. I sent an email to the recruiter mentioning that she might call me within the next 45 minutes. The next day, I got an email, not apologizing but rather telling me that "she missed my note yesterday"?!? She asked if I have any time available the next day, I sent her a time and never heard back again. Linkedin experience was extremely disrespectful and unprofessional. Especially given that as a candidate, a first call for me means spending a significant amount of time learning about the company, the products and the market, and going throught the hassle of arranging the logistics during a work day - twice.']
[u"The interview process consisted of an initial call with recruiter and a phone call meeting with 4 web developers. The call was a half hour which involved discussing of my skills and how I would handle certain situations, just to get an idea of where my skills were at. After that, they had me speak to 2 more developers using http://collabedit.com for live coding sessions which enabled them to see me code what they asked me to. I first had to develop a small widget, just the basic html css and javascript for how I would do it, simple enough. The third guy had me create a function for adding a class in JavaScript, given an element or ID string, and the class string to add. He was looking to see if I understood the DOM and use of NodeType for checking for if an element or string was being passed and how to add the class to the className. The fourth guy was a senior web developer and he asked me questions that had to do with prototypal inheritance and the prototype chain. He also asked me to create a function that would flatten an associative array into a single array which was quite an involved question to ask. He had asked me to create the addClass function which I said I had done for the previous guy and could send him the code for what I had done. I was told later when following up that they had decided to pass, and I got a message from the senior developer with feedback for the addClass function I sent him, which he had several concerns for what I coded for it. I was aware of all the issues he had stated and wasn't expecting such a harsh response. When I wrote the code I wasn't under the impression that I must create a fully working function on the spot, but it apparently was what the senior dev was expecting which is what his decision to not hire me was based on. Unfortunately he did not allow me to produce a revised version which I had done that addressed all his concerns and some he had not mentioned in full. He never responded to me about any issues with that version."]
[u'First there was a telephonic screening round in which they asked some web based testing related questions and general testing related questions. They also asked to write code through collabedit tool. After that they called for an onsite interview. There were 4 rounds. One was taken by the manager, another one by a qa autoamtion lead, one by peer QA, and one by a developer in the team I had to work. All the people were nice and friendly and asked some good coding related and web testing related questions. They asked me to write code on white board. Optimize the solution, come up with different scenarios to test it.']
[u"1 phone interview, 2 onsite technical interviews and a really soft, easy interview at the end. Standard programming/algorithms stuff, altogether pleasant. Lots of free food and stuff, although transportation wasn't reimbursed (I didn't particularly go out of my way to get it, so whatever)."]
[u'I was contacted by email by a university recruiter after I applied to a recruiting position online. We set up a 20 minute phone interview. It was pretty much just telling him my background experience and going down the jobs on my resume. At the end of the call, he told me that he wanted to push me through to the second round to speak with a Sales manager in SF.']
[u'Very professional interview process Recruiter met me in lobby and walked me out at end of interview I even received a "goody" bag I was disappointed because the team obviously did not agree on job requirements before-hand, and asked misleading questions during the interview.']

[u'A recruiter contacted me via their own website - LinkedIn! A junior recruiter talked to me first and then a senior recruiter called me. The recruiters were courteous and punctual and had taken the time to read my resume and asked interesting questions. I was a little skeptical as being a C++ guy, I had very little java experience. They told me they are language agnostic which sounded ok to me. I was then setup for a technical phone screen which was a most unprofessional experience. The interviewer was late by 22 min. I almost thought they had stood me up. When he called he sounded rushed and it was evident he had not read my resume. He asked me to describe my projects and then cut me off mid-sentence - he was not even interested in my work history. This was followed by some standard java questions which I answered but I also told him I had no java experience and he was taken aback - another sign he had not read my resume. He gave me two programming questions on collabedit, rpn and justify. I coded up the first and he agreed that what I had written would work and as soon as I started the second problem he told me he would be kicked out of the conference room so I had to hurry. So effectively I had less than 40 mins for what was supposed to be an hour long interview. He hung up and told me I had 15 mins to finish the code on the collabedit session which was still live. I got no further input from him and even though I posted comments and questions in the chat in collabedit, I got no reply. He clearly was not reading my code and I should not have bothered. It was not a good experience and the recruiter emailed me a couple of days later and told me I was not a match.']

[u'Reached out to them the second the recruiter sent me the invitation email to interview with them but didn\'t hear a response back for almost 2-weeks. Scheduled a call interview with them to which they were an hour late to and then admitted he didn\'t read my resume. Following this I was told it would take a week for them to escalate my resume to a senior level recruiter, no response for almost a month. Another phone interview, again the recruiter said he didn\'t even have my resume or read it, and this time I was told I was still too young in the industry but they would pass on my resume and to expect a response in a week. Another month, no responses from anyone even as I emailed/called everyone for news. Finally had a time set to have a THIRD phone interview with a member of their Ad Ops team. The man was late by 30-minutes, yawned continuously throughout the interview, starting to talk to someone as I was speaking then said "Oops, I thought this was on mute" and then once the interview was nearly over he just said "Okay we\'re all finished, bye!" and hung up without telling me anything. At that point I thought the interview was over, the emails I sent were never responded to and I assumed I didn\'t get the job and moved on with my other interviews. Two-weeks passed and finally I got a email saying they\'d like to bring me on site for a 2-hour face to face interview. I responded saying that I had already taken a job with another company who did not drag me through THREE MONTHS OF PHONE INTERVIEWS to just get a face to face meeting with someone and I had given on them.']
[u'Three different phone interviews and one one site interview. Spoke with Recruiter two times and then two managers at the SF office. They were all very nice but the Recruiter mixed up a couple of dates and people of contact. For a company that brokers the hiring process for other companies I thought they should have the best recruiting team in the country. Nothing too bad, I was only surprised by this.']
[u"Applied to posting on my graduate school alumni job board. * Phone screen the next week. * They said they'd call me back in 3 weeks...didn't happen. * I then emailed and called several times. No response. I gave up. * Two more weeks later they contact me (I had thrown away all my notes by then!) * On-site interview the next week. They were 45 minutes late. The interviewer hadn't even read my resume. * Two days later they call saying they'd bring me back for 2nd round interviews. They'll call in two weeks to set it up. * Three weeks go by...no word. Several emails & calls from me + two more weeks...nothing. I'm giving up on them. Would I really want to work for people/place this inconsiderate, who repeatedly don't follow through with what they say they're going to do?"]
[u'Hearing about the Intern position in Career Fair. Applied through school Career Service Website. First round Phone interview by an Software Development Engineer.']
[u'Got contacted by a recruiter on, yes, LinkedIn. I was surprised given my limited web background, but wanted to see if I could get an offer. The recruiter called me and we had a nice chat and she setup an interview with a senior recruiter. The day I was supposed to talk to the senior recruiter, I got an EMAIL 30 minutes before the interview saying they reviewed my skills again and would not be moving forward.']
[u"Received a inMail from one of the recruiters for a interview scheduling for a position that I haven't applied. I sent my available date and times. I haven't received any response from the recruiter so I sent an inMail and asked what happened. I haven't received an answer to that mail either. I would have expected a respectful process from a company like Linked in but they let me down."]
[u"Interviewing at the Chicago office - consisted of a phone screen and follow up phone interview then a 2 hour on-site. The entire process took quite a long time, and the interview didn't happen until 5-6 months later. Understandably it seems they are working out some growing pains in their hiring process."]
[u'I was contacted by one of the LinkedIn recruiters based on my LinkedIn profile. The recruiter arranged for a phone interview. I was invited for an on-site interview a few days after the phone interview. The decision not to hire me was conveyed by phone within a week of on-site interview.']
[u"Can't belive a company who provides a recruiting platform can be so late at responding. I applied almost 3 months ago and got a call in July. I gave 2 telephonic interviews. No technical questions. The recruiter said that they found a person who had more experience."]
[u"Applied on Linkedin website and later contacted by recruiter. 45 min phone interview began with questions about candidate's previous experience and then some questions about a specific programming language (depends on the candidate's resume and the team applied, mine was Java). The last part of interview consisted of 2 coding problems on an online collaborative editor."]
[u"LinkedIn recruiter contacted me thru LinkedIn itself. Had 2 HR phone calls, asked very standard questions. Following are 2 x 45 mins technical phone. They are relatively easy. Then on-site which consist of 5 rounds. After passing all that, had one last phone call with the team manager. Overall, It is a very pleasant and smooth interview process. LinkedIn HRs and Interviewers are very professional and friendly. HR usually respond within 2-3 days. Work environment are very good! I would definitely apply again if I weren't in!!"]
[u"Contacted and phone screened by an internal recruiter. 2 phone interviews and 2 onsite with the team, cross-functional manager, and the hiring manager. The entire process was professional, well organized, and welcoming. No questions were too difficult or out of line in any way. It was mostly a discussion about experience, style, and vision. It's a young and energetic company and they know they are a part of something special."]
[u'They took on the interview with 2 telephonic screening rounds. Then on Skype - 2 groups, 4 rounds each. Due to issues related to immigration, they postponed it. After a few months, said that the group had found better people for the position. HR not great at following up.']
[u'Very professional hiring manager. Good discussion. Respectful.']
[u'Inteviewer was quite unprofessional. Interviewer did not call and later recruiter told that she was busy. Candidate should be informed if he is not going to be called. After this next phone call was scheduled after 2 weeks. I cancelled to take that call, because 1 month of wait for a phone screen interview is veri high.']
[u'The hiring and interview process was relaxed but pretty difficult. It was obvious that the interviewers knew what they were asking and why - in order to gain insight into the personality and intelligence of the interviewee.']
[u"I had couple of phone interviews with different teams. My read of LinkedIn is that they require prebaked people in their technology stack. This is something big companies (like MS/Google) do only for contractors. For full time employees its always a long bet to hire great people who have the interest and potential to grow the company. My first interview was with for mobile phone dev. The person was very nice however was very disappointed that I don't know javascript (my resume does not even have JS written as a skill). He asked me to find an element in a sorted array which I did correctly to his satisfaction. But, expectedly, the recruiter said team does not want to move forward. My second interview was for backend dev. I know java because of my android background but I am a .NET person. The interviewers expected someone who is great at Java. Any ways in one hour first there was tech screen questions on Java. Then they asked two questions which I think is flawed because the interview and interviewee are both rushed. First one was really easy (one of those on glassdoor). Second one was to write a deep iterator. This is a tough question to complete in 20 mins (I mean to think the algo and write code). Also, I felt the interviewer was rude. This was a pass/fail question for him (write code for me or hang up the phone kind of attitude). Only plus point is that their recruiters are really nice people."]
[u'HR was very friendly. Consisted of (technical) phone interview and then two in-person interviews. Brush up on: data structures, data manipulation, and big-O notation/runtimes. Be prepared to code in person.']
[u'Contacted by recruiter through an inmail on LinkedIn, very impressed by the knowledge and professionalism of recruiting team. Completed in depth phone screen with recruiter, then Manager and did 2 onsite interviews, one of which involved a presentation. Very happy with interview process, everything was well organised and I was continuously informed of feedback and next steps.']
[u'Phone screen followed by 2 on-sites. Everyone was punctual, professional, prepared, and personable. Realistic expectations of the interview process and timelines were clearly communicated and I felt like they valued and appreciated my time. The things that impressed me the most were: the high caliber of the people I met, their excitement about LinkedIn, and they were clearly thoughtful about my experience as an interviewee.']
[u'Recruiter email, hiring manager phone interview, recruiter in person, hiring manager in person. 3rd round in person with 4 people. Follow up from recruiter and manager.']
[u'After the two phone screens, I had a full day of interviews on site. Question around design and problem solving. Question on how to convey an idea. Towards the last two interviews, I got tired of talking.']
[u'Straighforward and professional process. Very respectful. Questions surround background, sales strategy, office location optimization, etc.']
[u"I was originally contacted by one of their technical recruiters. I'm not on the west coast, so he asked if I'd be open to relocating for 'the right opportunity.' I had two rounds of phone screens using Collabedit; they weren't overly difficult. One was more algorithm/data structure oriented, the other involved some core Java threading concepts and basic architectural design. I apparently did well on the phone screens, and was flown out for an on site interview. Like others have mentioned it consisted of 5-6 rounds with pairs of interviewers and lunch. For some reason most of what I'd guess were the 'junior' interviewers didn't show up though they had been on the schedule, so most of my conversations were 1-1 instead of 2-1. The interviews were all technical except for one with someone who was a manager which was more of a general 'how would you solve this problem' question which involved whiteboarding out a high level architecture/control flow. The rest of the questions were pretty standard large tech company interview fare, though I was pleasantly surprised that there were a few open ended design questions for decent sized systems, and one asking me to explain the architecture of a project I'd been working on. It's nice to not be grilled for six hours about CS minutia that you will never use day to day and talk about some more real world problems. All in all I had a very positive interview experience except for with one interviewer. I had choked at one point while trying to write an iterative version of a recursive method I wrote to solve a problem. For the rest of the interview I felt a little 'off' answering the rest of his questions, and felt that there wasn't good communication between the two of us, or I just wasn't asking the right questions for clarification. He cut the interview short because we'd run out of time and we grabbed lunch. During lunch we had a good chat about the company and random other casual topics. As I noticed that the lunch time was wrapping up I asked if we could circle back to his earlier questions that I had been struggling with because I wanted to understand the problem better and figure out what he was probing for. His response to that was the only mark against the whole interview process I'd give. He said something about answers ending up on glassdoor and other interview sites and wanting to prevent that. I didn't feel like that was an appropriate response. Am I more likely to post the answer or problem because I didn't nail it during the interview? If I'd passed his section with flying colors he wouldn't be asking me not to post anything. On one hand I understand his frustration because having interviewed probably close to 100 applicants over 5-6 years some of my problems have ended up here on glassdoor (notice that I haven't posted any problem specifics; sorry memorizers). On the other hand it's usually easy to tell if someone has prior knowledge of the problem and to throw some twists in to change things up. Being interested in the problems he'd presented I just wanted to find out if I wasn't understanding the problem, the communication wasn't good, or something else. After flying home I didn't think I'd be getting an offer from them since I'd choked on one section of the interview. A few days later I heard back from the recruiter that the initial feedback from the interview team had been good, which surprised me a bit. I received an offer from them shortly afterwards. The whole process from initial contact to final offer took almost three months, but I wasn't actively looking for a new opportunity, and wasn't in a hurry because I had a cross country move and a lot of baggage to shed before starting with them."]
[u"Visited a friend at their Mountain View campus for free lunch, and got contacted soon by a recruiter after passing along my resume. The recruiter sent links in an e-mail to resources that help you prepare for CS fundamentals, including the 'How to hack a Google interview' pamphlets. Quickly scheduled and went through just one technical phone screen, where I had to write code using CollabEdit and talked on Skype. There were 2 questions: interviewer pasted a function signature for 'double pow(double a, int b)' and I had to write the body. That was pretty easy, but you do have to know the fast exp algorithm. The other question was implementing 'double rpn(List<String> ops)' to compute some result using RPN. This was also very easy (using a stack), but do watch out for edge conditions and handle exceptions. Got confirmation for onsite interview after 2 days, and gave myself a week preparation time before meeting for 1:1 interviews (actually, there's a main interviewer who does 90% of the talking, but is often accompanied by a trainee) by 6 pairs, covering the areas: technical presentation, 3 algorithmic programming problems, 1 system design problem. The first interviewer walked me to lunch and chatted about my work history--nothing technical. Just make sure you have rehearsed lines about your accomplishments, and be enthusiastic. The following 3 interviews (in 3 hours) were all on programming. The first one is fairly short: implement 'int[] intersect(int[] x, int[] y)' given 2 sorted int arrays, and provide the big-O for your best solution. The key here is to think through the problem (but talk so they don't think you're stuck and idling), then write on the write board. The interview room was only around 8'x6', with a small round table and 3 stools, and a full wall of whiteboard. The hardest part, unless you're already familiar with the drill common to top Silicon Valley companies, is writing code on the whiteboard where it's difficult to add and delete lines, such as when you need to declare a new variable half-way down the board. There were 3 panes, and for some questions I had to switch back and forth, which likely confused me when I was wiping lines with my hand and adding ugly arrows to insert lines (instead of erasing already crafted lines), and messing up indentation. You get the idea. I understand that good whiteboard presentation with clearly legible writing is important, but I wished that wasn't tackled on as you're trying to solve a tough coding problem. One of the interviewers pulled out his phone and took a photo of the whiteboard of one of my least proudest work (I'm usually known as an anally clean coder). The system design question seemed hardest as I got stuck on trying to use more complex structures than was probably necessary, like load-balanced message queues, distributed hashmaps of sorted structs containing 5 URLs and their timestamps, and using LRU methods to GC the old data. I had to ask for a hint, but that likely sealed my fate. The better, but certainly not the only, solution would be to use buckets of a fixed time interval. Seems easy, but often times the bad ideas just won't go away when under pressure. In the final session, the interviewer asked me to pick my favorite project and describe the design in detail. Actually, the paraphrased question was 'you just hired a new developer on this project, how would you get him/her up to speed on developing this new feature'. I described a bit about project and release management logistics, but they were more interested in hearing about and seeing class diagrams, module, component, and network topologies. Finally, the question that threw me off a bit was (since the project I described happened 10 years ago): how would you modernize the project for 2012? What different components or approaches would use and why? One thing that I reacted negatively to was all the interviewers were scheduled to arrive at the room on their assigned hour, and since the first one was late by over 10 minutes, most of the sessions ran past their hour slot with next interviewers opening the door and interrupting my thought process, only to be told 'can we have 5 more minutes?' and having the interviewers standing up and nodding nodding, basically saying 'alright, just wrap it up'. I waited 2 full days before being e-mailed about the rejection--no personal call unless you've made it past the gate, I suppose."]
[u'Phone interview, Face-to-face interview, mock presentation']
[u'I was first contacted by a recruiter. Two phone interviews were arranged. The first interviewer asked some basic questions about my resume and then we went into the technical questions. Two questions were asked, both about searching in sorted arrays of numbers. The second interview was almost identical, except that the question was more about algorithm design, which required general problem solving skill.']
[u'Two phone interviews -> super day with 5 1:1 interviews -> offer']
[u'I was in touch with a very kind and down to earth recruiter in the NYC area who made mee very excited about the organization dispite the fact that I had been on this site and seen some not-so-favourable reviews. 1) initial phone screen where I had to expain my education and professional experience back to front, then we discussed why I am interested in the opportunity and my extensive staffing knowledge and what i can contribute to the role 2) phone interview with the hiring manager 3) Panel interview with various team members']
[u'Applied online through Linkedin. Contacted the next day and offered the interview. Process was fast and the people were very helpful. The whole process included one telephone clearing interview and once that was passed I was invited to an interview. The interview was 1-1 and aimed to gauged my knowledge and desire for the role. Offered the position.']
[u"In order to honor the NDA I signed, I'll try to be as vague as I can about the specific technical questions. Had a phone screen first. The phone screen consisted of two programming questions. The first one was very simple. It was a question just to make sure basically you can program and design unit tests for it. It was easy to get bugs in it, but as long as you know how to program, you should be fine. The second one tested your data structures. Make sure you know what lists and sets are good for. The recruiter was very responsive. I got a response within the next three days. He offered me good luck and transferred me to another recruiter to schedule the on-site. I had to change the on-site date once and the recruiter was very professional and accommodating. The on-site was extremely nice. To be honest, I wasn't particularly interested in LinkedIn at first, but the first phone interviews, recruiters, and campus really impressed me. Their campus is right next to Google's. Once you go in, they give you an ipad 2 for the day, where you can check your schedule and interviewers. It consisted of 5 interviews along with lunch: 2 technical, 1 design, 1 explain one of your projects in more detail than anyone would ever care, and 1 behavioral. The 2 technical interviews were fairly straight forward. First one was really straightforward in fact. It was just a very long programming question, but it was overall pretty straight forward and did not involve any special algorithms or data structures. The second one was a bit more tricky. All I can say is get very familiar with binary trees. I know for sure I got at least the first part very well. Second part, I spent a lot more time than I should have on it. The part I felt I really bombed was the design questions. The design question is actually posted on glassdoor by another candidate (hint hint), but I won't say it in order to honor the NDA, but definitely study the questions the other people have provided here. In any case, this interviewer impressed me most with his knowledge and he just seemed really smart in general. I'm sure this was the interview I got rejected on though. Definitely know your distributed systems. I was unfortunate in the fact that I never had any experience with distributed systems. I must also mention though, the last interview for the day was probably one of the worst interviews I have ever had. Not in terms of me not doing well, but the interviewers were pretty junior and seemed very nervous. It felt very awkward since one of them was studying something, and not paying attention at all, and the other was continually checking his time, obviously hoping it would be over soon. They drilled me in one of my projects into more details, which I kept giving, but it felt very uncomfortable since there were many instances when it felt like they did not know what to say so there were pockets of silence. Over all though, the experience was great. I did not get an offer, which I was a little disappointed with since I thought I did decently overall, but I did not do well on the design question and ultimately, it's their call on who they are looking for."]
[u'I applied the position online. After about one week, I got an email from the recruiter. They list several roles in the software engineering team and also attached a short questionnaire to let me fill out some basic questions. For example, which team do you prefer, what is you availability, why LinkedIn? Within in one week, they arranged a Technical Phone Screen Interview. This interview involved a real-time collaborative editor which allows me to do actual coding. It was a two dimensional array problem, the interviewer helped me to go through the process. After that he asked a lot of modeling questions. For example, describe a machine learning method, how to deal with sparse data?']
[u'I got a response for my application that they want to schedule a phone interview with me. I had to 2 technical phone interviews which were simple to crack. Then they called me in for on site interview. On site interview consisted of 4 rounds. They asked me core javascript questions and basic css stuff. They give lot of importance of html markup. One should be wise in choosing HTML tags as it effects search engines. Then there was another guy who just made me cry asking jQuery stuff.']
[u"Best Interview Experience... Ever! I was really well prepared but at the same time I've been treated with respect and honesty, both during the phone interview and the 1:1."]
[u'Phone interview by two teams and selected to onsite for one team. Environment looks like a organized Facebook but with a lot of Indian employees.']
[u'A company recruiter had contacted me to check out my interests and asked for update resume. After hearing back they want to schedule a phone interview, there were three different people involved in the scheduling process that I felt a bit chaotic. The phone interview requires computer access that they will ask you to code through an online collaboration tool. As for onsite, in addition to coding, data structure, and algo stuff, they will also evaluate your communication skill (i.e. pretend I am a new hire, how do you ramp me up)']
[u'HR does the phone screen , then the phone interview with test']
[u'Was one of the most unprofessional interview I ever had. Part1. I started all the proccess with a phone interview with an HR agent. Part 2. Face to face interview and a writen test . After 2 weeks I received an email (an automatic generated email) with -"we do not have an appropriate position for you at this time". Part 3. four days later I received a phone call with "good news" telling me that I am still in the proccess and another interview is required. Part 4. Scheduled the phone interview next day with Omaha Office with 2 agents . I felt happy and confidend as I had a good interview . Checked in LinkedIn profiles and the agent I started with left the company. Wrote an email to the new agent that manage the posted position for an update - they said I\'m still "in process " and they will get back to me. Meantime the same position with a specific language requirements (language I applied for) was advertised (managed by a 3rd new agent) . Here I wait anxiously another 2 weeks. I decided to write another email (using JobVite ) before Christmas and I received a Non Delivery message (previous it works fine) . Finally I sent an email to the new person in charge for them to tell me I was unsuccesfull. Here in Dublin it seems to be a big chaos and looks like the skills are not important . You need Look on your side not skills or experience. I feel very dissapointed as I trully believed in LinkedIn as a company .']
[u'A LinkedIn recruiter contacted me. After a brief phone screen, he told me that the hiring manager was eager to meet me. Another recruiter contacted me from there to schedule an onsite interview. She confused the position I was interviewing for then corrected herself in a subsequent email. The initial onsite interview was a half-hour meet and greet. I received positive feedback from my lead recruiter and was told that they would like me to come in for another interview. For this interview, I needed to put together a presentation based on a homework assignment that Recruiter 2 passed along. There was some confusion between the recruiters on the format of the interview, but this was resolved prior to the interview. That Monday, I presented to the hiring manager and another person on the team. They did not have much curiosity about my professional background and spent much of the time grilling me with business case questions that would be difficult for most candidates to answer on the spot. Recruiter 2 then set up an interview with the department head. The department head was more than 20 minutes late to call me. She apologized and we planned for a 5 p.m. Friday phone interview the next day. She asked a kind of business consulting question that I was unfamiliar with and unprepared for. Consequently, I was thrown off for the rest of the interview. Next, I received a call from my main recruiter who apologized for the question and told me that it was not something that he had prepared me to answer. He told me that I was still their top candidate and that they would work on putting together an offer letter in the next few days. The next day, the recruiter emailed me and said that they decided not to go ahead with the offer. His explanation was that the hiring manager had changed her mind after speaking with the department head. This was after I received a verbal offer that was reneged after wasting hours of my time. The whole process left me with a bad taste in my mouth.']
[u'I was contacted by a Linkedin recruiter. After having a 1:1 sessions with development leads was called for an onsite. My technical interviews I thought went reasonably well but I was declined.']
[u'Interviewer asked for a case study on elevator in a building Also asked for my background (enterprise solutions in S/W) He also alsked me why I joined MBA. Asked for my previous experiences and why I quit certain companies. Also asked how would I use my experience in Business to help linkedIn.']
[u"Some of the interview questions were decent (e.g. intersection of two number arrays) but non-coding questions were about a decade old. Especially when interviewing someone for a Principal position, lame questions can be avoided e.g. Question is: Would you prefer Java over any other language? Ans. I don't know all programming languages. I can compare against the ones i know. You can guess the response. Overall, it was pretty bad (i didn't learn anything, except not to interview here again)."]
[u'They really focus on general engineering skills - ie, algorithms, game design techniques, thought process of solving a problem on your feet']
[u'LinkedIn does not know how to evaluate candidates. I dont think they have the people who can evaluate candidates. After a rock-solid phone screen and onsite interview, I found myself puzzled on why I did not get the offer. They interviewed me for the wrong role, and I clearly mentioned this onsite. Even so, the interview consisted of a brutal 14 people evaulating me and I impressed every single one them. I also got a feeling that LinkedIn does not know what to do now post-IPO. They admitted, they are growing at crazy rate. But they are having a hard-time to cope up with it. Lack of vision and clear execution path seem to be impending this company.']
[u'The pocess was pretty chaotic and unorganized. They are growing so fast and you can feel that while interviewing! I was treated fairly though, and made aware of any speed bumps through the process. My recruiter was a great coach and helped me along the way. You phone screen a couple of times and present.']
[u'My interview experience in a nutshell: 3+ months, 14 interviews, 3 separate visits on-site to interview, and no decision yet. Not to mention, HR has missed a self-imposed deadline of "we\'ll let you know about next steps" on 3 separate occasions. Seriously, the worst interview experience I have probably ever had. I enjoyed meeting many of the people I interviewed with (with one notable exception) and the company seems like a nice place to work at. However, the way they have treated them throughout the interview process has completely turned me off. I have interviewed at other tech companies in the area (Google, Facebook), and this has been the most unprofessional unorganized process. Still have yet to hear about next steps for me, which is probably not good news. However, I will decline either way.']
[u'Overall it is a positive experience because Linkedin is one of my favorite companies. The two phone interviews went well because the questions about relatively easy. In the onsite interview they asked me a bout regular algorithm questions, DP questions, distributed system questions, a game design question and most-interesting project. The questions are not as hard as Google/Facebook and sit in the same level as Amazon/Microsoft. The people are generally nice except two interviewers looking and laughing at funny pictures during interview. I am confident with my performance on all the other rounds except the one with two unprofessional interviewers, they interrupt me multiple times and always persuade me to adopt their "best" solution. Finally I was rejected after 1 week.']
[u'1:1 straight forward interview']
[u'Met onsite twice for casual lunch with two different directors. Culture is relaxed but very energetic. Company culture values fun/humor and everyone seems like friends.']
[u'I really enjoyed the interview. It was very targeted to the role I was applying for. All the interviewers were very professional and easy to get along with. I was ultimately interviewed by 3 groups numbering 8 interviewers in total. You had your usual friendly people and hard interviewers that could smile more (nothing serious). All in all a great place to work!']
[u'I was first communicated by the recruiter who called me and had a normal background chat for about 30 minutes. He also gave me details about the company, culture, teams, etc. I was scheduled for a phone interview of an hour which also had coding involved. This round had one problem-solving question, which was related to Binary Search Algorithm application, went okay. I could reach a solution, and even though I took some time to reach the correct approach, the interviewer appreciated my thought process. I got mail for another phone interview which again was for an hour and I had to code online. This time it was a tough question about writing a program where given a sorted array, repetitions allowed, and given an integer, I had to return the start index and end index of that integer in the array. I chose the Binary Search approach but some modifications had to be made to make it optimistic in run-time. I failed to reach the exact solution, and hence could not clear this round. I think LinkedIn is a nice company to work with and I would surely consider applying again to it at some point of time in future.']
[u'The hiring process consisted of a brief phone interview (not technical) with the hiring manager. I was asked to come over for an onsite interview that would last for 3 hours. A day before the interview, the recruiter informed me that the interview has been cut short to 45 minutes. Couple of engineers met me at the lobby, seems like they were unprepared because they were looking for empty conference rooms right at the time of the interview. The technical questions were generally easy, if you know basic data structures/algorithms, Big O notation, you should be good to go. (definitely not as hard as google interviews). The interviewers were very nice and professional. I got the following feedback after the interview - " Interview went well. I sync up with interviewers and based on feedback the candidate has very limited technical skills geared towards C++ and little bit of scripting. Its a reject from our end" It\'s funny because the reason I applied for this req is because it stated "Extensive programming experience in Objective C or C/C++". Feedback to the hiring manager: you should get your requirements straightened out before you put out a req.']
[u"The interviewee draw the page of LinkedIn page for business account. Then he let me write the CSS/HTML on the paper. Kindly I learned CSS/HTML by myself and I use dreamweaver a lot. I just wrote whatever I remember for CSS and HTML. Obviously I can't to meet their requirement. So I didn't get further interview."]
[u'Positive: The hiring manager was very professional and knowledgeable. Most of the interview questions were challenging, so I felt future teammates would be smart people. Negative: Experience with HR was mixed. One person was very professional, very engaged. The other HR person booked me a flight ticket for 9pm-5am overnight flight. One interviewer was a bit unprofessional.']
[u"My phone interviews were fine and well-organized although one person called 10 minutes late. Things moved along quickly which was a good contrast to the reviews here, until I got to the in-person interview. The specific time / location were changed dramatically the night before the interview. Everyone I met was great, although most of the interviewers cussed which I found unusual. Afterward though, the long period without a response was disappointing and changed my opinion about working for them. Like others have said, if your business is a recruiting platform, you had better have a good recruiting process! Overall it wasn't a bad experience but it would have been a positive one if they had been prompt in letting me know that I wasn't a fit."]
[u'The phone interview questions were easy and related to the position I had applied for. As for the 1 on 1 interview the questions asked were in no way related to the job position, I was shocked and speechless I only knew how to answer one of the questions and could answer it in a confident manner. In the end I was not offered the position and the lady who interviewed me did not seem interested in what I had to say.']
[u'After applying online, the initial interview process moved quickly, with 3 interviews in the first week. A couple phone interviews followed the end of the following week. Two weeks later they told me they went with another candidate. The entire process took a month.']
[u"The recruiter contact me on the job application I filed. She asked a few Python questions and determined that I wasn't hands-on enough and said would check if there was a matching manager position for me. But she did say that even the manager position was required to be hands-on. I did not hear from her, as expected."]
[u"Process consisted of a 2 phone interviews, 3 onsite interviews. extremely professional demeanor.glad to be part of the company i truly admire.advice to be to not just talk clearly and answer to the point, but to 'listen' when the interviewer talks to you. so many times you are focused on what to say next, that you dont listen to something important they have to say.and yes, be prepared with basic questions that are expected based on your resume and things like'why this job' ' why not something else' etc"]
[u"Interview #1 (Phone Interview) [Day 1] - This was a call by the Recruiter to do some preliminary checks if the candidate is suited for the position. No technical questions was given during this call. No current and expected salary was asked here as well. Significant question asked was why the candidate was looking for a new job. Interview #2 (Face-to-face Interview) [Day 2] - First technical interview by a member of the IT Staff. Its a combination of theoretical questions and problem solving questions. 10 questions total. Session lasted for 40 minutes. Interview #3 (Phone Interview) [Week 2] - Second technical interview by another member of the IT Staff. Again, its a combination of theoretical questions and problem solving questions. Session lasted for 40 minutes. Interview #4 (Phone Interview) [Week 2] - Third technical interview by another member of the IT Staff. Again, its a combination of theoretical questions and problem solving questions. Session lasted for 45 minutes. Interview #5 (Video Conf Interview) [Week 3] - 4th technical interview by the Hiring Manager. This contained around 5 or 6 technical questions which is again a combination of theoretical and problem solving questions. There will be more discussion here as the Hiring Manager is gauging the candidate's capability to converse and see how the candidate's thought process works. Session lasted for 1 hour. Interview #6 (Face-to-face Interview) [Week 5] - Interview with the Managing Director. Questions asked is towards how the candidate sees themselves 5 years from now. Will also ask to discuss the resume from start to where you are at right now. Will also need to discuss how and why you are applying for the job and why leaving the current job. Basically, he will try to dissect you and your career and try to understand if you are the perfect person for the company Interview #6 and #7 (Panel Interview) [Week 5] - Just right after meeting the Managing Director, the panel interview goes next. This is an interview with the HR Director and the Office Manager. This is a long discussion as they will ask you (again) to discuss from the start to where you are working now. Including the in-betweens and why you moved from one company to another. They will also ask why join LinkedIN as compared to other company. Will ask what are your main strengths and weakness. They will also ask grey-area questions - which means that there really is no right and wrong but they want to know where you stand on that particular issue (ie. Will you support employees home PC/technical issues?). HR Director will ask the Office Manager to step out and the last question would be your current salary, expected salary and notice period. No job offer was given as they say they need to do the same for the last set of potential candidates."]
[u'My experience with LinkedIn was unbelievable, the most unprofessional interview process I ever had in my entire life. It took 2 months and I had to call them at the end of the process to have a feedback of the last of the 5 interviews I had. It all started in January with a phone interview with HR. During this call on laud speaker I heard people talking and laughing, the HR girl typing away and not even listening to my answers. The second phone interview took place 1 week after with the marketing boss and one week after I was given a written task with 2 lines of explanation. I did not have any idea what to write and I just pulled all the information off their web site. I gave my task by the agreed deadline waiting for a feedback by the following Friday. I did not hear from them for 2 weeks in which I emailed them and called them to understand what was going on. After these silent 2 weeks I was asked to have a face-to-face interview but I have to wait 2 more weeks to have the date! The day before my meeting I am asked to prepare a power point presentation with the task I wrote 1 month earlier. At the end of February I finally meet up with two people and I am asked again the same questions of the very first interview I had! They said I should know by the following Friday but they disappear again. 10 days after the face-to-face meeting, frustrated and frankly furious I had to call the HR manager to find out that they went for somebody else! UNBELIEVABLE! Especially for a company that has recruitment as a mission!']
[u'Was contacted by the recruiter and then got a confirmation for the Phone Interview. The phone interview wasnt very difficult. Points covered were: 1. Use of Reset CSS 2. Form Submission ( cases of return False, event.PreventDefault) 3. Explain Semantic Markup 4. Explain Clearfix 5. what is hasLayout 6. Inline js and addEventlistener ( Compare) 7 diff between == & === 8. speak of yourself and your role and experience 9. challenges you face Then i was called for a onsite interview I was to meet a total of four interviewers Onsite interview was a little tough for me as i wasnt so good in remembering all the syntaxes 1. Question on CSS specificity 2. Javascript question and write a performance efficent code of a given example. 3. event.target 4. Write the addClass function in native js 5. How do you design a Navigation Bar 6. Question on form submission - Submit a form with a input text field and some check box fields. Before submit check if atleast 2 checkboxes are checked . I could answer, but i was little fluent with all the syntaxes on native js. But this was a good learning experience']
[u'The phone interview was an hour, including online coding. First the interviewer asked about your resume, then coding questions.']
[u"I found a guy from LinkedIn posted a twitter saying he accept resumes. I send my resume and expressed my interest. About several days latter he contacted me for arranging a phone interview. He first asked about my experience, and we discussed a little about what he's being doing. Then he give the question like how to find the second larges element in a binary search tree."]
[u'First asked me about my resume. I was describing the detail of a research project I did last summer. The recruiter asked me how the algorithm was implemented. After that I was given an algorithm question. I need to find a number in a matrix. The matrix was sorted by row and column.']
[u'Applied on company website. Got call immediately. It was for tools development for the management of Linkedin Servers (NMS/ EMS applications development). Interview process took almost 3 weeks. They took 5 rounds for me - 4 face to face and 1 - telecon (from US). I cleared all of them. After that they said I have cleared all of them. They will arrange one more last one with US folks. But no communication after that. HR did not reply to mail nor picked up the phone. In short totally UNPROFESSIONAL people. They dont know how to communicate to people. At least have courtesy to pickup the call. HR at Linkedin India are immature. They called me 4 times to their office in the week days for face to face interview and did not even speak to me afterwards. No coffee/ tea/ water was even offered. Very arrogant. The reason I feel they rejected me was they got another candidate from my company. Pretty cheap, they could have at least told me/ rejected me in the beginning.']
[u"The bad: 1) they NEVER reimburse my travel expense! the person in charge of reimbursement never reply and the HR kicks the ball around. 2) well, the HR. the LinkedIn HR told me to show up at 10:00AM, and I was told at the front desk to start interviewing at 12:30PM! And here's nobody there to have lunch with me! So I thought of calling my old friends at Google next door and completely forget about the company for their lack of professionalism, since I already got an attractive offer from my other interview in the city pinned by a huge needle from the space. Fortunately another HR showed up. Then I spent 2 hours in the morning hanging out at a nearby starbucks (of course I paid for the coffee that they never reimburse, and i witnessed there how starbucks interview prospective coffee staff) before we had some mediocre indian food onsite. The nightmare hasn't stopped. the HR tried to persuade me into accepting the offer right after the interview like a (Toyota) car dealer without even giving me a concrete number. It was around 6 in the evening. I was hungry because of the just-so-so indian food. I was really too tired after visiting two west coast cities from the east coast and having two extensive interviews in 3 days. And she started to say I appear to have the passion for the company ... well ... that lack of consideration really ruined the image of the professional social network in my mind. The good that I have to acknowledge: 1) interesting (would-be) co-workers. Guess you won't miss Daniel if you run into the data scientist position. I highly recommend his blog (http://thenoisychannel.com/2011/08/08/retiring-a-great-interview-problem/). 2) Location. Well, that's a double sword since the campus site is getting surrounded by Google. But I do feel a very passionate hacker culture in the bay area. 3) the data problems at the company is highly unformulated. I guess there's plenty interesting things to exercise your ninja skills. Other things to notice: 1) they didn't seem to care much about what you did if you have a non-computer science PhD. Guess you'll have to think over that ... it's a double sword on your career. 2) where will the company go? It's a sure thing that LinkedIn will never gain such traction as facebook. I do feel that the headhunter activities have declined a lot recently. While companies embrace for twitter and facebook as primary engaging channel, where will the channel that only talks about professional interaction go?"]
[u"Two interviewers did this interview for me, starting with very brief introduction of their group (as simple as just tell you the name) and asked a technical question and then open ended question (or to say the question that they don't even know). When the turn for my question, they just super quickly speak none sense abstract rubbish and hanged as the second they finished. Plus, their hr girls are like just got dumped by her boyfriend every time they called and they just miss schedule, very NOT professional. Seems that LinkedIn doesn't know what to do now, just need the workers to finish codings for little things."]
[u'Initial discussion with the recruiter was good. He seemed very knowledgeable about the company culture, the culture within the group I was interviewing with and the specific job. He was able to answer my questions easily and thoroughly. Unfortunately everything went downhill for the in-person. The recruiter I had initially worked with went out of town so I was given another contact. That person sent me directions to the wrong building, when I arrived nobody seemed to know what was going on. Finally they told me to walk across the street to find the other building. The interview was very informal, I think they decided on the fly who would speak with me. The team members seemed in conflict about what the needs of the Executive were and when I spoke with the Executive that I was interviewing to support, that person seemed to have no idea what their needs were either??? The interview ran out of time and they asked me to come back later that afternoon or in the next day or so. When I followed up via e-mail I was given a tentative time/date for a couple days later, when I followed up to confirm, they never got back to me (this was the Hiring Manager)..................................still waiting. About a week later I e-mailed the recruiter to find out the status and never heard back. I did one final follow up and still never heard back. Finally, weeks later, I was sent a form rejection e-mail from their recruiting system. I have two pieces of feedback for them. 1. You should really just send a quick note to a candidate when you are no longer interested, it takes 5 seconds, it saves everyone a lot of hassle and I think it is just common courtesy. 2. Your company is located right in the middle of the Google campus, you are no doubt in fierce competition with Google, you need to be at the top of your game (I am speaking from experience with the Google recruiting process, and even though they are a giant company, it was still a more personal process......) Ultimately, LinkedIn lived up to the expectations set by most of the other candidates who have posted reviews of the interview process on Glassdoor.']
[u'I have just attended the written test of linkedin. The written round consists of 31 questions and 40 minutes. The topics they covered were:- some 5-6 in perl script programming 2 questions in database 3 questions in c++ 10 questions were puzzles which were very tough some questions on network programming']
[u'Had an onsite consisting of 2 hour-long interviews. Both were standard interviews for a college intern. Interviewers were friendly and also open about their own experiences. My interviewers were from separate teams, interviewing for their teams (so if one likes you, you can get hired onto that team).']
[u'A senior engineering VP reached out to me using - of course - LinkedIn itself. He had taken the time to read my profile, venturing a friendly remark about a well-known company at which we\'d both worked a couple of decades before. We engaged in a friendly and informative email exchange, and he arranged to call me early the next day. We spoke for about an hour, getting along very well. He asked if I\'d be up for a follow-up technical screen the same day with a senior member of his staff; I answered in the affirmative, knowing I\'d need to move around a couple of commitments. So, his direct report contacts me at the appointed time, and almost immediately I experienced a "oh no it\'s going to be one of _those_ calls" sinking feeling. With no preamble, the guy - a former CS professor from Bulgaria - launched into a series of questions about my day-to-day influences, e.g. "What do you read to keep up with the Rails community?" I truthfully answered, "various Pragmatic Programmers publications, Stack Overflow, Y. Katz\'s blog," etc., which seemed to satisfy him. OK, fine. He immediately then challenged me how, programmatically, I would go about determining the set of integers between 1 and 100 evenly divisible ("remainder 0") by 3 but not by 9. Fine: it\'s going to be one of those "how does this guy think?" questions, which I knocked out quickly. To my confusion, he immediately blurted out, "Wrong... wrong... that doesn\'t work," which I found a bit unsettling and bizarre. He\'d asked me to do the exercise on paper (not how programmers actually work), which I did. Insisting it would work, I mentioned that I should have opened a console window and fired up the interactive irb interpreter, where Ruby programmers often test short exploratory blocks of code. I had done that, and found that my solution actually worked. The guy got hung up on a "thinking out loud" utterance I made at one point, involving the use of the \'yield\' keyword, and chose to force us down a conversational cul-de-sac with no productive purpose in mind. At a certain point, I knew with complete certainty that I would never work with or under this guy, and told him I\'d like to terminate the interview. Oddly, he wanted to continue, but by that point I knew that every minute spent in unnecessary combat with my arrogant interlocutor was an additional point of blood pressure increase not worth experiencing. The high irony of the incident is this: they\'re trying to staff a team to build out an applicant tracking system, some subsystem of which would, ideally, generate metrics for the effectiveness of interviewers. Sincerest best wishes to them in that endeavor.']
[u'Very slow process. Tthe recruiter took very long to get in touch. Once she did, things moved faster. I had a phone interview with a Principal Scientist who sounded a bit shaky. Overall, average difficulty level. Heard from them after repeated emails that they decided not to proceed with my application.']
[u'Ok, this started as a really smooth interview, very nice people, free food and snacks, an iPad with me the whole interview period duration, shortly an environment similar to that\u2019s of Google with les politics. A lot of factors made me say: \u201cOk, if I got an offer, I am accepting it\u201d. During all the loops except the last one (which I am going to comment on it shortly), the general feedback was very positive. Everyone was commenting on how smart I am, giving comments of type \u201cYeah, this is the same solution we adapted in our production environment, etc.\u201d, so I was 100% certain that I am going to get an offer until I reached the final loop. Usually in any company in software industry, the last loop is reserved for the hiring manager or someone higher than him in the food chain but with LinkedIn, my last interview was with a couple of QA engineers (a male and a female) whom look like it was their first interview loop ever. They first gave me a technical question which they thought is going to take like 30 minutes but when it was solved in like 2 or 3 minutes, they kind of got puzzled cause they had no idea what they are going to do in the remaining time, so what did the female QA engineer did? She just invented a question out of nowhere that she was not even sure what she wants out of it. The question was simply: \u201cImagine an ingoing operation that keeps pushing integer numbers, we want to be able to quickly tell the median among all the last integers that were pushed to the system\u201d Fair enough, it was also like 2 minutes answer for that question. She didn\u2019t get the answer (although the male QA that was with her got it just right away), so I spent like 30 minutes with a gazillion examples showing her how does it work, finally when she got it, she said something like: \u201cOh no, I just wanted to know the index of the item in the middle of the array formed by all the incoming numbers\u201d, I told her are you talking about n/2? This is like a single line of code! She said \u201chmm, ok, no problem!\u201d So after that interview, I was 50/50 sure about whether I\u2019d be getting an offer or not, a couple of days later, I received an email that I am not getting an offer. Up until this point, I might have given them a neutral feedback judging by how great everything else was if it was not for the other screw up they had! So in any company in the industry, when you plan to interview an out of state candidate, you usually confirm the interview date/time and then you do everything for them (reserve air ticket, hotel, car, etc. and pay for them all) and send them the confirmation. If you pay for anything, it would be just taxi fare from/to airport, meals and maybe gas for the rental car. They would reimburse you these tiny expenses back in like 3 weeks or less. Right? This has been my experience and my friend\u2019s experience in nearly every software company in the market. With LinkedIn it was different. Although they did the reservations and everything, when I arrived at the rental car company, they asked me for my credit card info cause no one paid for the car!! Same thing happened for the hotel, so what if I was not carrying enough cash on me or a credit card with enough balance?!! Why the they didn\u2019t communicate back that those things were not paid for?! Why even they didn\u2019t pay for them if they did the reservation?! I\u2019ve no clue! For the experience to even become more worse, their reimbursement process was said to take 4-6 weeks (don\u2019t ask me why someone would need 6 weeks to do a simple reimbursement process but anyway), I contacted them after 5 weeks, and they told me that they sent the check to the wrong address (which is something that puzzles me cause I gave them my address printed on a paper which means they can\u2019t say that my handwriting was bad or any crap of this sort) and then asked me to wait an additional week. If I didn\u2019t receive it, then they can send it via direct deposit. Now it\u2019s like 3 days after I gave them my bank info and still, no money and no reimbursement for the over $800 bill that I had cause of this screwed up experience. They just contacted me that they sent another check and asked me to wait one more week!!! Advice? If they contacted you for an interview, run like hell!! Oh, on another comment, their interview process IS REALLY LONG, it took like a month and a half from the first phone screening until the actual full loop!!']
[u'A telephonic interview in which various basic algorithm questions were asked. Then managerial questions like why do you want to move, how did you hear about us etc.']
[u'I was referred by friend to Linkedin. They reached out to me back in March for a phone interview. This was a standard phone interview that focused on my background and reasons for looking at Linkedin. After two months they got back to me and scheduled a webex presentation. The presentation is set up with a few errors on the slides, you are expected to review it all and correct the errors. The presentation is held like a mock customer discovery call. The entire presentation process was fine, the follow up after was brutal. I was told that they would get back to me in 2 weeks. Of course I called after the time had passed and all I received was, "they\'re still waiting to make a decision". After a month and a half I was called in for an in person interview. The interview was held with 4 different managers and took a total of 4.5 hours of the day. They quizzed me on what I knew about them. You are expected to know everything about your interviewers. STUDY their profile\'s before showing up. After the interview I was given feedback that I did well and I should expect an offer 1 month later and several follow up calls from me, I was told that they decided to promote from within but I was still a prime candidate. They also told me that they\'re in the process of relocating the sales staff and this was going to create more positions and they still were very interested in bringing me on board but it would be in the December timeframe. The the next several months I continued to call and check on the status of the position. Every month the gentleman I spoke to would tell me to try back next month. Finally I decided to move on and look for employment else where. Then I received a call from the Linkedin recruiter who had all my information and explained that they were now ready to bring people on board. I was told that I would need to do one last in person interview to meet the new Director before offers would go out. After doing this and receiving positive feedback from the director and the recruiter I was again left to wait. 1 week later I received a verbal offer, 2 weeks later I was told they decided to go with a different candidate.']
[u'2 phone interviews + 1 onsite interview that included three different timed tests of your skills (basic & advanced computer skills and language skills).']
[u'The interview started with the staffing agent calling me for a 30 min phone conversation. I was then brought in onsite to complete a skills test and a writing sample. I felt there was a lack of communication between the recruiter and the manager who I was interviewing with. I was not prepare for the sales writing sample. The manager asked me did the recruiter tell me about the writing sample. I also I had to take a day of work to interview with them. I was not happy with my interview experience with Linkinden.']
[u'Interviewed by the recruiter , then 1:1 interviews with Engineering Manager, followed by an on-site group/panel interview. The interview sessions went fairly well (I thought). Received feedback after 5 days that the engineering team declined to make an offer']
[u"Very unorganized. The office in Omaha can be a shock if you are not prepared - people in shorts and hats, riding scooters around the aisles. There wasn't a conference room available to conduct the interview (which started 17 minutes late), so we had to evict someone from their office. The two interviewers just asked standard, run-of-the-mill interview questions straight from a sheet. There was little to no interaction on their part - they seemed like they were just playing a role in a play. My biggest complaint was the timetable associated with the process. I was informed several times that the company would be making a decision in a shortened timetable, in order to get the person in-house for training as soon as possible. I interviewed on Friday, and was told by both interviewers that I would hear from LinkedIn one way or the other by the following Friday at the latest. After waiting until Tuesday (11 days after my interview) with no response from LInkedIn, I called them to withdraw my name from consideration. I was told that I was being offered the job, but at much less salary than was discussed - so that made my decision that much easier. The office seems like a fun place to work, but there is little to no procedure and policy on how to conduct the interview process. When a candidate is given a timetable, the company should live up to those expectations, rather than permit the recruit to twist in the wind for an extended period of time."]
[u'Met with two different system managers at LinkedIn. Process was very unorganized. People I met with had no idea that they were meeting with me until the interview. Asked random questions about unix. Tried to get a feel of what my experience was. They were unprepared.']
[u'Phone Interviews - 2 One on one interview - 6 Each interview was an hour long. It was not a progressive interview (increasing in difficulty). All the interview rounds were the same. It consisted of an algorithm question that was asked to solve']
[u"Talent and experience aside, It's all about networking at LinkedIn. First and foremost, before you even apply for a job at LinkedIn -- Update Your Profile to 100% Complete! Use the platform to do your homework on the people you are meeting with, and identify who you know in common. It's expected. Dress business casual. No one here wears a suit or a tie. Ever."]
[u'The process began with a technical 1:1 phone screen. This part is not very difficult, they test basic algorithms and data structures knowledge. You have to code online and in real time with the interviewer using collabedit. The onsite interview was exhausting and unnecessary long, I got there around 10 am and left at 5 pm. I was interviewed by 10 people in 5-6 sessions. The interviewers were nice in general and they tested: technical communication, algorithms, data structures, architecture/design and culture. I only failed to complete 1 of the questions but that was enough to get rejected. Overall it seems like a good place to work at.']
[u'My worst interview ever. They terminated it at the second interviewer and I was lead out of the company. I can only comfort myself by saying that at least I saved my time.']
[u'It was really easy working with the HR people. There was an initial phone screening call for about a half an hour which was very conversational. I got along great with my HR interviewer. Then they setup a phone interview with one of the engineers for a technical phone screening. They were about 5 minutes late calling me and then we talked about my background and linkedin for about 20 minutes. Then we jumped into the technical questions using collabedit.com. I could barely understand the interviewers english (he was Indian). I was only asked two questions. The first was to implement Integer.parseInt. Not use it, but to create the method from scratch. ....very creative (being sarcastic). The guy was clearly not happy with my answer and there was a lot of silence. I thought if I voiced where I was coming through with my answers and walk through my logic that I\'d get some points but we stared at this one question for 30 minutes. I know that I did it wrong but I was walking through it. Then with about 10 minutes to go we "moved on" to the next question which was similar, implement Array.sort from scratch. He asked which algorithm I was using and it\'s speed/big O notation. That was the end. I knew within the first 5 minutes of the technical portion that it was going to go badly. Waste of time for me and the interviewer. I will never interview with LinkedIn again. I got a "your background and qualifications are not a match" form rejection within 15 minutes.']
[u'Recruiter contacted me in Friday afternoon through LinkedIn, their own website. I told them I have a pending offer, and they scheduled phone screening on Monday, and then on-site interview on Tuesday. Very efficient. When I get the interview confirmation letter, I am surprised that I need to meet a dozen interviews. Actually, I stayed in a meeting room and interviewers came in pairs and asked me questions. It seems that one of them is the primary interviewer and the other just shadowing him/her.']
[u'Very cordial interview. Interviewer was actually interested in the kind of work I want to do and my past projects. Though i was rejected I recommend people to apply for this firm']
[u'Had two phone interviews with data science group. One was more design questions, machine learning background check etc. The second interview was strictly coding, algorithms and stuff.']
[u'I had a phone interview with HR, hour long phone interview with hiring manager. Next, I did a presentation for the team and more skills tests. Then had onsite interviews (4 hours). HR seemed nice, but busy, two different people emailed and called me, neither aware that I had spoken to hiring manager. You should follow up with them if there is a lapse.']
[u'Had 2 phone interviews. Then an onsite interview. Very chaotic and a little disorganized. had a wide variety of people interviewing. Onsite had 6 sessions. Some with 2 people. Looks like they are still figuring out what to do after ipo.']
[u'I was contacted by linkedin recruiter for data scientist position for which my background does not at all match. Similarly I had interview with Linkedin in exact same way for some front end technologies. It is ridiculous to know the company with largest professional network can not find right people for right jobs. Linkedin recruiters are very rude even after telling them my background is different and I want to pursue different role. They will make you give an interview for some random position in their mind for you and do not allow you to interview for positions for which you are a good match.']
[u'It was a batch day, I did a couple of standard interview and then gave a powerpoint sales presentation']
[u'Well it started with the interviewer and me logging into collabedit.com. They gave me a method signature in java and asked me to complete the method signature. It seems that if you know java in and out then you can atleast clear the phone interviews. No questions on algorithms, data structures but java. Well most of their internal systems are implemented in java so i guess they need guys with detailed java knowledge.']
[u'The interview process was very long but well worth it in the end. I have 2 phone interviews and 7 face-to-face interviews.']
[u'I had a 1-hr phone screen setup and the manager who spoke to me was courteous and respectful. He started with introducing himself and his team and the work they are into. I was then asked to speak about my experience. I was asked a coding question later, but I did not come up with a good solution. I coded the program effortlessly after I was given hints by the interviewer (well, of course :P)']
[u"They asked me to have an internet connection open and use collabedit. The interviewer kept getting phone calls and kept going out and in and was hardly focused on the interview. He also complained that he is working on someone else's laptop and could not work properly on it. I got 2 questions shown below and after answering them I got an email from the recruiter saying it was not a match."]
[u'The hiring managers at LinkedIn are the best. They do their jobs really seriously and I like it! They always try to help, try to find a suitable position for you. However I can\'t actually say the same thing for the technical interviews. The software engineer I talked was not helpful at all. I was a little bit stressed, as it was my first technical phone interview about Java. We got disconnected for three times! It actually never happened to me before... interesting... Then we tried Skype. First he introduced his job, what he was working for, his position. Then he directly passed to the technical questions. I was asked some linux stuff that I never heard before. I\'ve been using linux for many years, but... Anyways, then he asked me a programming question abou HashSet. It wasn\'t difficult but, the atmosphere that he was talking was really rude! I got freaked out and had an error in a line. Even when I waas writing the code, he was typing something on his computer. Then he just said "OK, they\'ll connect you in a bit" then turned the Skype off. Never gonna apply to LinkedIn again...']
[u'Same questions as in the glassdoor.com. LRU cache, designing hangman web application, generic HashMap implementation, etc. Interviewers were expecting very specific answers in the way they want to hear it. Corrected me almost every single line while writing the code. I was supposed to have 4 interviews. Was very abruptly and rudely stopped during the third interview. Hope they will be little more professional in future. Know in and out of Java, collections, APIs, LRU Cache, etc and you should easily be through.']
[u"I applied for a job as a campaign manager and after a week received an email from the hiring manager to have a phone interview. So I had the phone interview of 20-25mins in which I was asked general questions about myself, education, work experience , future plans and then about LinkedIn. After that, I went on holidays so once I came back I got the email again to have another phone interview from someone in the US office. So I gave that interview which was an hour long and more detailed but mostly work related questions and my education. After that interview, I was sent an online test of 2 hours. I did that test and then I had a phone interview with the recruiter regarding salary etc. Please note, all these steps I was never given any feedback at any stage. After the test I was contacted to come in for a face to face to interview with the dept head and then I was send two case studies and asked to prepare two separate presentations which I'll have to present on the day. Hence, the onsite interview was of half an hour and then an hour long presentation which was taken by 3 people. One was actually present in the office and two were from Dublin and US office on webinar. After that interview, within 24hours I received a call from recruiter to have a phone interview with the senior manager in US. Hence, I gave that interview. In all these times I was never given any feedback and reaching so far I assumed I am doing good and will most likely get an offer but to my utter disappointment after 2 days of phone interview I have been told that I have a bad news and they cannot go further with the process. The reason was that they need a more experienced person for this job. I thoroughly enjoyed the whole process and it has been very lengthy process for me but at the last time you are mentioning to someone you need a more senior person was kind of unfair. Did they not see my CV and my experience? I am a bit disappointed as I worked very hard for it and presented myself really well and this was the comment I got from the recruiter. I wish I could do better than that. But I enjoyed the whole process and learned alot."]
[u'The initial 30 minute phone screen was conducted by a marketing manager and consisted of a brief review of my background and an in-depth discussion of the role. I was tasked with analyzing the current talent.linked.com website and preparing suggested improvements for the subsequent on-site interview 2 days later. The on-site interview was 45 minutes and started out with my presentation of proposed changes to the talent.linked.com site. We then reviewed the current Google Analytics for the site and this developed into a general discussion of what information we could derive from their user data and how it related to promoting their hiring solutions to employers. I was then asked to rate myself from 1-10 on skills ranging from copywriting to comprehension of SQL queries. Following the interview I sent a thank you email and never received any sort of response from the interviewer nor the HR person that had initially contacted me.']
[u'First, I got a phone call from the recruiter. She was very kind. She started with general questions about myself and my previous experience at work. Then, She got through details in relation with sales and marketing. She even asked me how much money my own small business was making per month, how I was helping to save cost sales and go on. I did not get to the next round. She said that my English was not good enough and anyway, the next round was going to be an exam to prove my level of English at writing. I do not know if this was true.']
[u'Had 3 phone interviews: 1) Usual stuff with technical recruiter. 2) Sales pitch and broad questions about my experiences with the hiring manager. 3) Tech Screen over collabedit.com with a random engineer who, after the usual questions, asked to code a generic (String key, Object value) LRU cache in 35 minutes. I spent almost all the time designing. I did not feel that the problem was appropriate for a phone interview.']
[u'I get 1 phone screening, 1 general conversation with head of sales europe and a 1:1 with my future manager.']
[u"The interview was straightforward and involved a brief presentation/pitch, soft skill questions, sales-related topics, LinkedIn's culture and growth opportunities. The hiring manager certainly knew what he was looking for in the candidate and communicated the job responsibilities very well."]
[u"LinkedIn was a very extensive interview process, they really want to make sure that you're the right person for the job. I had 3 phone interviews before I was brought on site, from there I had 5 one on one interviews. The technical difficulty of the interview was on par with other top companies (google, microsoft, fb). I really enjoyed interviewing with them."]
[u'Really decent interview.Was asked two questions to code and what was my most interesting project.HR person is very efficient and the techincal phone interviewer hardly gave any hints ..but very polite otherwise.']
[u"I was referred by my friend. I got a call from the recruiter in a day or two and then right away the recruiter said are you ready for a phone screen. I was shocked because I was driving. I like challenges and took it positively, and answered 5 questions. The flip side, I think they just need code monkeys, and can't see the forest view. So decided to not go for it. Short term Linkedin is good, long term they will face challenges."]
[u'Applied through website and got contacted by HR. Then set up a tech phone interview a week later. The phone interview was really really wired. Without any "Hi or how are you", he asked me 4 simple questions without online coding. Then he asked me "do you have any questions?" I asked him to give me a brief introduction about his team and what they do. Surprisingly, he answered: I do a lot of work. What you mean you do a lot of work??? and I asked 2 other question, he answered with no more than 5 words. And then it\'s over. I interviewed a lot of companies, no one interviewed like this. Make me feel rude, disrespect and unprofessional. I did not get responses yet, but i\'ve already decided to reject this company.']
[u'I had an informal phone interview, a technical phone interview, and an on campus interview with 4 teams.']
[u'I have a very negative impression of LinkedIn after my interview. The engineers did not take time to introduce themselves, talk about my history, the job or team, but dove straight into the technical portion. I was interviewing for a position requiring expertise in data mining and NLP, but instead of talking about anything related to that, they treated me like a code monkey. Questions were mostly about data structs, alg and how much do you know about Java.']
[u"Applied online and got a phone call from HR a week later.Out of the blue, she wanted to interview me straight ahead. I said to her that I was not available and sent her time and date I could talk. Obviously she did not read the email and never sent back a confirmation of date and time for the phone interview. I had to contact her again, and she just replied 1h before she wanted to call me,although I was not available on that day. HR process seems to be useless and very disorganized. Got the phone interview, and she could not even read the companies I worked for on my CV. Very abrupt and annoying interview. She did not seem to be very organized. You could just hear her typing on the background, and other people behind her laughing out loud. She just threw questions after questions in a very unprofessional manner.It was not a very pleasant interview. She did not sound professional at all. Questions were typical HR:what you did, what you know about the company,what your career plan etc... End of the interview,she did not even ask: do you have any questions? Just said, your profile is too technologies orientated so it does not suit that role. She won't proceed to the next level. I would love working for LinkedIn, but they have to have more competent and professional HR people who are organized and pleasant to talk to."]
[u"I got the rec on LinkedIn's website. I did a phone interview that went well and then went in for an all day of one-on-ones. The interviews were standard Valley stuff. Whiteboarding with algorithms, design questions, etc. I enjoyed the group I met but I felt that there were too many interviewers (6 total). Afterwards, the recruiter said that she'd get back to me ASAP and that they'd move fast. That didn't happen. It's been over two weeks and I still haven't heard back - I'm assuming they're passing."]
[u"I was contacted almost immediately after applying to the posting as they're growing fast and anxious to fill the job. They are upbeat and passionate about the company, but a bit full of themselves due to their success. Email turndown from HR person -- a complete turnoff after going to 3 rounds. Very disappointing given that they met me in person. Also, one of the interview rooms was as cold as a meat locker which also upset the sr management I met with, but we stayed in the room."]
[u'Phone interview followed by 1 on 1 interview based on where you are located. Followed up within 1 week.']
[u'I was interviewed by an assistant because the hiring manager was "unavailable" late Friday afternoon. The guy was completely disinterested and condescending. The arrogance of pre-IPO was very apparent. Questions asked were seemingly elementary and my qualifications were more than sufficient for this foot in the door position.']
[u"interviewed a manager who is very friendly and asked general qeustion and a DB question. interviewed a guy who asked a LRU cache coding. interviewed a panel also asked design and DB questions. Then they stopped the interview saying I'm disqualified. Oh well, I don't seem interviewing for DBA, wonder why i'm being ask many DB questions. Perhaps I was flunked at the LRU cache coding part even though I feel i did ok. I don't think I deserve the feeling of being kicked out."]
[u"The interview went well, although it became clear to me during my interviews that the job wasn't a good mutual fit. I'm guessing they felt the same way, since I never heard back from them. I'm ok not getting a job, but not hearing a word from the company afterwards is just plain unprofessional."]
[u'The location and office is very great. The interviewers were very friendly. I applied online, be scheduled 1 phone interviews(non-tech) and one tech phone interviews within 2 weeks, then the onsite. The onsite contains 6 1 on 1 interviews, all white broad coding.']
[u"The guy I interviewed with thinks he is a know it all because he was a lawyer for three years at some high firm before coming to LinkedIn. Then he goes on to saying how he was to good at what he did and wanted to be able to look at people in the eyes. He will brag about it during the interview so you don't have to worry. He'll come across rough but if you stay on top of your feet he'll like that. Also be aggressive and let him know you are a planner. Melinda the HR lady is great. She'll help you with anything you need."]
[u'Arduous and confused. They had almost no HR process in place']
[u'I had a tech phone interview with a software engineer position in the revenue group at LinkedIn. I was able to solve both problems asked by the engineer correctly. The problems were only of average difficulty. We used collabedit for the interview. The linkedin employee seemed to be satisfied with my solutions. A few days later I was told that they were going to pass on me with no feedback or reason explained to me. I learned (in part by recruiter) that they were learning to test/interview software engineers with my skill set. So I felt they were not honest and were basically using me as a guinea pig for their own selfish purpose even worse, collecting some interview data and possibly doing this to many other people interviewing for this fake position. Possibly they are developing some corporate tool and testing it with real people, gathering data, and making you believe you are really being considered for a software engineering position when you are not. LinkedIn, please be serious, stop playing games and stop wasting peoples time. Dont use real people as guinea pigs for your models, studies and/or corporate tools.']
[u"I initially came across the role by leveraging LinkedIn and found that I was connected to people at the company and requested an introduction. There was the obligatory phone screen interview followed by a 1:1 with the hiring manager and one of his colleagues. The questions were good and I thought the process to be sound when looking for a candidate. Post the first phone screen interview and the one on one I sent my thank you notes to everyone who participated in the interview process only to get zero acknowledgment or response for coming in. Its been a long time since I have interviewed and maybe that's common place today but thought that was lacking and should have been telling as to the people I may have worked with. Also very disappointing was the follow up of the recruiting team after the interview. I received a single e-mail post the interview from the person recruiting for the role letting me know he should know something by next week as far as the next steps in the process and would get back to me right away. Almost a month later I get the dear John e-mail advising they have decided to pass on my application but will keep my resume on hand for other opportunities which we all know is lip service for there still may be hope. I read other interview accounts from Glassdoor which spoke of the interview process at LinkedIn and their lack of respect for you or your time but pressed on only to find the experience to be true. I think I may have dodged a bullet."]
[u'The interview process consists of one phone interview and 2 on sites. I had a positive experience interviewing with LinkedIn. I looked over the reviews here before I went. Some criticized the working environment and the interview process, but I experienced the opposite. Everyone I met was friendly, smart and they spoke highly of their team environment. The building/conference rooms where I interviewed in were clean and updated. The hr person I worked with was very helpful and communicated well. So maybe they saw the reviews here and made improvements? They asked a few harder questions, which I see as a good sign because you can expect your future coworkers to be competent. I think the company has great unrealized potentials still, and I like the director and the hiring team a lot, so I ended up choosing them over another more competitive offer.']
[u'Was contacted by HR for a phone interview the day I applied. The next night, the recruiter emailed me to let me know that I would be having my phone interview with the recruiting manager instead of having an HR screen. Sweet. Spoke with the person who would have been my boss, and it went really well. I have a diverse background, but he seemed excited to speak with me and invited me in for their "Batch" day at the end of the call. At the Batch day, I was supposed to have 2 interviews, and do 1 presentation. The first interview was with someone who would have been my peer. He was dumbfounded as to why I had been invited. He had a script to ask questions from, but because my background was not directly in sales, he didn\'t know what to do, other than spend most of the time telling me that he didn\'t know what I was doing there. 2nd interview was again with my hiring manager. Kind of weird, since he already had interviewed me. He asked me what I wanted to talk about, and I brought up the question of fit; he assured me that hard sales experience was only one factor. Ok, I felt better. Time for the presentation with the 3rd guy. He came in to the room, and said, "we\'re gonna pass, and I have no feedback for you." Ok, talk about a waste of time! Overall, probably one of the most unpleasant experiences I\'ve ever had.']
[u'process is very fast, you get feedback almost instantly.']
[u"The process started with a quick phone screen with an HR person. The second interaction was a phone interview with a lead product manager. The interview consisted of some standard PM questions regarding metrics and feature development. The third step was a set of 4 1:1 interviews at the office. Unfortunately, since the first interviewer was late, the whole process ended up being a bit rushed. Questions ranged from personality questions, situational questions, my thoughts/impressions of the industry, and also direct questions related to specific issues LinkedIn was encountering at the time. If you are interviewing as a PM, be sure to know the site/product really well and be prepared to offer thoughtful suggestions on improvements. For any suggestions, you'd likely be asked how you would implement."]
[u'Phone interview was setup by a recruiter, and the phone tech interview was great. Was asked basic UI questions related to Javascript, (closures, functions, object oriented) CSS, AJAX, etc and then was called for onsite interview. Interview panel consisted of 3 developers and one product lead. Product lead asked general questions like reasons for quitting, what interests you, how was previous proj exp etc. Deveopers asked about javascript questions and asked to write pseduo code, and a CSS guru asked quite a bit of css specificity questions, Javascript questions included - binary tree, closures, inheritance, execute a function without a constructor -> (function xyz(){....})();']
[u'Got a call from an agent from UK at 8pm on a Thursday. after lots of question she asked me how was my "Spanish Brazilian". its 2010!!! Study a little before ask this. Brazil speaks PORTUGUESE!! After that she sent me an email at 9pm saying if i could meet the Dublin HR Manager on the next day. I answered her that\'s I have a wedding on the next day and if its extremmely important I could go very early in the morning. Than she said sorry, that she will call me on monday, as thats very short notice for me. I want to sleep and than the lady sent me more 3 emails during the night (more than 10pm) saying that I should go for interview on the following day at 8am for interview! I wake up ate 8am and just answered her thats a very very short notice and that I was not online anymore and did not received the msg. She said to not worry and that she will rebook for Monday. on Sundar night (9pm again) I got an email saying that they want someone that speaks Spanish and that they wont do any interview with me. i never answered her... I really dont know what to say to this lady... maybe: go study again to be a decent HR? Thats the most disorganized process I ever been in my life. Hope this not happens to anyone else... I still trust Linkedin, but they have to change their HR people and process if they want to grow as they are saying...']
[u'I applied to the position on their website and I got a phone interview which lasted for 45 mins. It was completely Java. I was grilled with questions including thread safe class, hashcode() & equals(), design of website etc.']
[u'First, I had a phone screening, then a phone interview. He asked me two questions on data structure. They were questions with arrays. Then I was asked to come in for a on-site Interview with 4 people. First person asked me about algorithm questions : BFS Search for a tree Second person asked me about data structure questions : Sorting Array Third person asked me about OOP designing question which was very vague. Last person asked about data structure questions : Implement LRU Cache']

[u'As an employee referral who was actively involved in interviewing with another company in the SF Bay area nearing the offer stage, I was given a phone call from a mid- to senior-level HR person within a day of the referral coming in. We went through a brief discussion of skillset required and the technologies to be used in the position. After that, I was set up for a second phone interview, this time a technical interview, with the manager-level developer that I would have reported to were I to continue through to completion. The technical interview was focusing a lot on JavaScript and rarely discussing any other technologies (unlike what the HR person had discussed with me). We concluded the interview, and I expressed my concern that the job did not sound like the fit for me, as I really wanted to work more on presentation and user experience doing interaction design and HTML/CSS/JS rather than working mostly on things like performance tuning JS, etc. We ended the interview amicably, and the manager stated that he would like to consider me for future openings in interaction design and/or UI engineering that were more ux-focused. I was contacted a couple of months later to see if I was interested in a more ux-focused position that opened up recently, but I had already accepted the offer from the company that I was interviewing with in parallel to LinkedIn and declined. Once more, they asked if I could be contacted in the future in case things changed. I said yes, as LinkedIn seems to be a very solid place to work in the SF Bay area in web development. The experience was very good, even though their HR did not seem to have as much of a grasp on the details of the particular job function as they should have had at that time.']
[u'The company recruiter found my profile on LinkedIn and had a brief interview. Then we scheduled an technical interview with a developer, questions were not difficult. After that I went on-site for a one round of group interview, and then went for second round on-site with 4 consecutive group interviews.']
[u'I was first contacted by a recruiter through my LinkedIn profile. I then sent a reply email with my resume and interest in the position. After hearing little response, I also applied online. It was only a month later, I received an email to arrange a talk with the recruiter over the phone. We then spoke later that week, where we spoke about my previous experiences, what the job was and where the team was going. We then agreed to schedule a panel interview in the next two weeks. I went to the panel interview with three team members of different levels. I did not actually think the interview went that well so I was surprised to find out they were interested in but needed to see more candidates...basically stringing me along. I just found the whole experience to be very wishy-washy and prolonged. They say they will get back to you within the next 24 hours, but that seems not to be true. Poor communication. Bad response times. An overall terrible experience!']
[u'One phone interview followed by two on-site interviews. Meetings with Scientists including problem solving: covering machine learning and graph problems at LinkedIn.']
[u'All day on site interview, talked with 7 people.']
[u'I have never experienced such a dysfunctional interview process. The phone interview was rescheduled 3 times, and it doesn\'t seem that there is much comunication in the HR/Recruitment department because when asked to give my availability, they came back with times and dates that I said I wan\'t available. The process was not fluid at all with a great deal of "hurry up and wait". When I was finally was provided my travel info for my in person, ( 1 day before) with my fligh info, car rental info and hotel info I found out when I got there that it wasn\'t direct billed and I would have to pick up the cost and submit to them later, which isn\'t a problem but again clear communication would hae gone a long way. Interview process lasted all day with very little time between interviews. Company did apear to have great energy and that great start up vibe. Recruiters that shuffled me from place to place didn\'t appear to me the caliber that I would expect from a company liked LinkedIn but heck, maybe I was expecting the recruitment area to be better in person than my experience over the phone ( I was wrong ). I met with quite a few talented people through out the day so that helped to forget the experience that I got up to that point. After the Interview I followed up with the "Thank You" emails and letters, but I heard ZERO feedback from the recruiters when I called, so I figured that they didn\'t like me for some reason. Well 2 months later I get a call from a recruiter going over a pre offer. Then weeks again go by and no communication by the recruitment team. I then emailed the recruiter about the company policy to get reimbursed for my travel and I get this very unprofessional email that stated" If you read the email that so and so sent you with your travel, it tells you what to do." WOW.... Well any remaining desire to work for LinkedIn evaporated with that email. When I did finally get an offer, I declined.']
[u"Totally unprofessional from the beginning. Their HR is a disaster. Took almost a month just to schedule an interview. Many reschedules in between. The workplace stinks inside out. I swear. Just visit once and you will know. Engineers are packed like slaves inside. No space to even walk around without the hurdles. They think they are Google just because they are next door. They try copy Google in every aspect. But they don't realize they are not even close. Engineers and the Managers I spoke with are absolutely clueless on the technology and e-commerce side. They think they are smart. Most these guys seemed like C programmers and still think that way to program in Java! They don't seem to understand Java Concurrency at all. They don't even know Merge Sort!! Seriously. But they think they are the smartest. Many of them were really rude. But I demonstrated right to their face how immature they were in terms of technical know how. All in all, this company is a disaster. I think it is just foolish to hire people on LinkedIn. It is not hard to build fake community of referrals on it. The 2B evaluation is just one more bubble waiting to be burst. With the kind of Engineers they have, I doubt their success."]
[u'When received the call for the interview, the woman on the phone wanted to first know how I heard about the position. After providing this information to her, she wanted to know who I knew from the company that told me about the position. I once again provided her with my knowledge of how I applied. After answering this question, she went on to say that she just does not understand how my resume ended up on her desk for a call to be interviewed that I must have known someone. After scheduling the interview, the person by the name of Cheryl that I spoke with had the same questions for me. These were the only questions that she had for me along with. The company would not pay for reloction and how did I feel about that? After feeling interrogated, she said that she would get back to me with what the departments decision was. Based on the fact that the questions asked were not a refletion of my skill set, I already knew the answer.']
[u'I was approached by direct recruiter. There was an initial phone screen and then an onsite interview. They asked Data Structure and Technical questions. It was extremely well structured. 1) How do you search through a lot of data..ie. TB. 2) Multi Threading Lock Question. ie Bounded Queue']
[u'I got a call from a recuruiter, and followed by a phone interview. The interviewer asked couple of questions about algorithms. Some how he was not getting the message from me what I was trying to say. May be over the phone was killing the talk. But, got accepted to on site interview. The interview on site took 3 hourss ( a complete waste of my time). First guy came in, surprisingly different one than expected as other guy did not show up, and asked me 3 algorithmic questions. Looked like he was satisfied with the answers as I was suggesting different solutions than he had pre determined in his mind. My solutions were very close in terms of time and complexity. Second, an UI person came in. 10 years of experience in plain HTML/JSp static pages. No clue about hard core JS. Kept asking me about my experience. Did nt even have UI related questions to ask me as I think she paniced when I told her that I tech lead UI guys onsite and off shore. She asked me couple of pre-prepared JAVA questions rather than asking me UI questions. "how to desgin Hash_map or table" and "what do you need to implement equals method". Come on, UI person needs to stick to his/her domain. Third person, ex-google. Came in to test general coding abilities. We had a good talk over coding patterns and class loaders. But it did nt matter, as recuriter came in saying first 2 ppl did nt think that I am a best fit. I was like, did you guys even read the resumes before asking to come in on-site. totally wasted my 3 hours. Had no idea what were they interviewing for.']
[u'I got an email within a week after I applied to set up a phone interview with one of the engineers. The interview started off with the interviewer asking me to implement an iterator,LRU Cache and a doubly linked list in java in Collabedit . I thought I did pretty decently given the one hour time frame, however I got an email back saying that they would like to interview me again because they thought I could do better !!. Anyway second collabedit interview general java questions and some tricky collections coding questions later,they sent an email to offer there regrets...']
[u'I was contacted by a recruiter via LinkedIn. Had a phone conversation with the recruiter to setup a technical phone screen and explain interview process. Technical phone screen lasted 45 minutes. Recruiter called me immediately after to ask me for my availability for an on-site interview. First on-site interview consisted of 4 engineers and hiring manager. Everyone was extremely friendly and great to talk to. The next day I received a call from the recruiter to schedule a second on-site interview, this time with 4~5 VPs and Directors. At the end of the day we discussed compensation. I received a verbal offer the next day.']
[u"I had a very bad first impression. As another person mentioned here, the working environment is very disturbing. They have a central area where all the engineers are crammed in, just like an assembly line. The desk area were messy (lots of wires) and people were sitting next to each other. I understand being a team player and having a need to work at close proximity but the setting at LinkedIn is not atoll private, no cube walls just literally an assembly line setup. As I walked to the conference room I was pretty much decided on not working at this place. If you want to work with someone then you can always invite them in your cube or if more than two people need to work then use a conf room. I for one need a personal space to work and I don't want to look at other people's clutter. I was confident and didn't care much at this point. The first guy asked me some basic prepared questions on binary trees. After answering the question I would ask a counter question just to gauge their technical skills. I asked him about his thoughts on getting or making a balanced binary tree and importance of randomized algorithms. The guy couldn't carry the discussion. It was fun though."]
[u'Great people, very easy conversations. All seem to like their jobs and the people they work with. Has start up feel and attitude. Hard workers, really want to change things online. Seem to be slow moving in decision making and spotty in communication to candidates']
[u"The recruiter was efficient in setting up phone interview and on-site interview. Phone interview consisted of Java questions: basic, object reference, singleton pattern. On-site interview: linked list questions, recursion, multi-threading, and unit testing in terms of Test-driven programming (This is where I stripped). They're big on Agile I think. The main thing is you were not only required to solve the problems but also solved it the way they wanted/suggested."]
[u"some simple java questions: about equals and hashCode. this is an interview from the hr, so i guess it's pretty simple."]
[u'I had a call from an hiring manager. Nice call, smart guy. He ended with a couple of technical questions selected by a team of engineers (yes or no answers). A few days later I had a call from an engineer of the same team (team of 15 engineer). Pretty bad. The guy made me feel uncomfortable. Didn\'t say "hello" or "hi" he started with "this is gonna be a technical call". Well... he started with a couple of questions. I did well but I had no reaction from him... quite frankly he was not happy. Until I got stuck on one question, then he started a "conversation".. he was happy. Also, I had a general design question. I had a lot to say, some good stuff but he was waiting for a specific answer regarding a specific technique. I had no more information...no hint. He was clearly bored, don\'t know why! I thought I did well and I was expecting another round with another engineer in order to make a smart decision (team of 15 engineers). Finally I got a email from a recruiter telling me that is over. What would happend if had another guy on the phone? bad experience.']
[u'I was asked a combination of algorithm and coding questions as well as design questions. The interviewers were pleasant and would offer hints when I got stuck. I thought I did well but apparently some of them thought that they had to offer me hints and another one felt that I was giving very short answers. Would have loved to get an offer, but that was not to be :-)']
[u'Applied it via Linkedin job search, then connected by HR people. The HR lady was very nice and asked a few questions. Then scheduled with a phone screen. The interviewer was not the hiring manager as posed in the job profile. He is a senior software engineer in the team. The interviewer first canceled the phone call 5 minutes before the interview time. The next day, I asked when to do next. He said 11am next Monday. At 11:20am next Monday, I sent him email to ask if he will call. He replied that he totally forget it and will call in the afternoon. Finally, we could get to talk. The first question he asked is "How to get a concise summary from a user\'s Specialties?" More or less it was a keyword selection problem. So I suggested with a common approach. He then asked details of how to do it. I explained the algorithm and suggested possible language software. Then he asked for one project about recommendation system listed in my resume. He asked how to build data matrix. I was stuck a bit because it has been quite long time. He then stopped the discussion and close the call. I wrote him a thanks letter later, and also mentioned the data matrix question. After a few days later, I did not get any message. I called HR, they told me I have been passed.']
[u'Handling of the interview was professional. Had a phone and 1:1 interview.']
[u'The LinkedIn recruiter called me - they found me on LinkedIn. She asked me a few really simple questions about my background, and why I wanted to work for LinkedIn, and then said she would set up a interview with the hiring manager. The hiring manager was really pleasant, but it quickly became apparent that they were looking for someone who is a hands-on technical person with a bit of project management skill, rather than a project manager who understand technology. We went through the full interview - lasted about an hour. The next week the recruiter called me back and said they really wanted someone more technical.']
[u"Spoke with a recruiter, who works directly for LinkedIn. Recruiter in California / I'm in Chicago. The appointment was set and the recruiter called right on time. Many of the usual questions were asked of me. Examples: tell me about yourself, why do you want to work here, give examples of your sales background, how many people did you manage in your previous job, etc. Felt as though the recruiter was somewhat distracted. I could hear typing in the background, and I presume recording my answers to her questions. I may have been on speaker phone, which I find distracting. Recruiter was somewhat snippy when I asked a probing question about the job responsibilities. Interview lasted about 20 minutes and by then, we had determined that I was overqualified for the position. The way LinkedIn titles their job positions is misleading, in my estimation. For example, this job opening was titled Account Manager. However, after discussion, it became clear to me that the job did not call for management; Rather more of a coordinator or subordinate role. I was mildly annoyed that the recruiter would not have known of my over qualifications, just based on my resume. I'm rating the interview difficult, because I felt the recruiter should have known that I was extremely over qualified for the position. The questions themselves were what you would expect."]
[u"I applied in July, took them a month to call me for an interview. Went in for that, met with a couple of the managers, thought it went well, they said they'd get back to me by the end of the week. Week goes by and nothing. I email to follow up (and yes I'd sent TY notes) and again, don't hear back. I write them off thinking I didn't get it and they just aren't going to tell me. Five weeks after the interview I get an email from them wanting me to come in for a second interview that week. I go in and meet with the higher level managers, again, think it goes pretty well, they said they were going to make a decision by the end of the following week. Send more TY notes. It has now been almost a month since the second one and zero communication from them. I'm guessing I didn't get it. I don't see how a company that is supposed to be social and based on communication and helping people find jobs can be so poor at communication and have such a poor hiring process."]
[u'I applied on line for the Analytics Scientist position with LinkedIn and they contacted me back after 2 weeks. The HR lady was very nice and helpful. After she filled me in with all the necessary info we set up a time for 45 minutes phone interview with the Manager of the Analytics department.']
[u"Contacted by recruiter of LinkedIn, HR asked several Java questions, had a phone interview with the hiring manager, passed. Then went to onsite interview in the second day. Each interview has two interviewers (I think one senior, one junior), this surprised me a little bit because I'v never seen this situation. The interview questions are mostly algorithm and coding related, not quite difficult for any senior engineer, but unfortunately I got stuck to one question ( recursive function related), became a little anxious, then one interviewer complained that my attitude is very bad. Done :-("]
[u"some simple java questions: about equals and hashCode. this is an interview from the hr, so i guess it's pretty simple."]
[u'I had a call from an hiring manager. Nice call, smart guy. He ended with a couple of technical questions selected by a team of engineers (yes or no answers). A few days later I had a call from an engineer of the same team (team of 15 engineer). Pretty bad. The guy made me feel uncomfortable. Didn\'t say "hello" or "hi" he started with "this is gonna be a technical call". Well... he started with a couple of questions. I did well but I had no reaction from him... quite frankly he was not happy. Until I got stuck on one question, then he started a "conversation".. he was happy. Also, I had a general design question. I had a lot to say, some good stuff but he was waiting for a specific answer regarding a specific technique. I had no more information...no hint. He was clearly bored, don\'t know why! I thought I did well and I was expecting another round with another engineer in order to make a smart decision (team of 15 engineers). Finally I got a email from a recruiter telling me that is over. What would happend if had another guy on the phone? bad experience.']
[u'I was asked a combination of algorithm and coding questions as well as design questions. The interviewers were pleasant and would offer hints when I got stuck. I thought I did well but apparently some of them thought that they had to offer me hints and another one felt that I was giving very short answers. Would have loved to get an offer, but that was not to be :-)']
[u'Applied it via Linkedin job search, then connected by HR people. The HR lady was very nice and asked a few questions. Then scheduled with a phone screen. The interviewer was not the hiring manager as posed in the job profile. He is a senior software engineer in the team. The interviewer first canceled the phone call 5 minutes before the interview time. The next day, I asked when to do next. He said 11am next Monday. At 11:20am next Monday, I sent him email to ask if he will call. He replied that he totally forget it and will call in the afternoon. Finally, we could get to talk. The first question he asked is "How to get a concise summary from a user\'s Specialties?" More or less it was a keyword selection problem. So I suggested with a common approach. He then asked details of how to do it. I explained the algorithm and suggested possible language software. Then he asked for one project about recommendation system listed in my resume. He asked how to build data matrix. I was stuck a bit because it has been quite long time. He then stopped the discussion and close the call. I wrote him a thanks letter later, and also mentioned the data matrix question. After a few days later, I did not get any message. I called HR, they told me I have been passed.']
[u'Handling of the interview was professional. Had a phone and 1:1 interview.']

[u'First I had a phone interview - the guy asked me questions about memory leaks and immutability - it was more like good discussion. Next, at onsite interview was mostly writing code - equals, hashcode, linked list etc.,']
[u'I did a phone interview first where the interviewer asked many knowledge questions about Java, JavaScript and database. The on site interviews were split into two days. The first day was 5 interviewers and they mostly asked coding questions plus some programming language questions. I did them mostly correct but was still declined. They seem to have a very high bar.']
[u"For a company with as much upside, LinkedIn's recruiting process is highly flawed and poor. I interviewed 8 different people. It took weeks to receive feedback specific to where I was in the process and it was very apparent that the interviewing team was not prepared for the interviews. The culture is very much a start-up. I was a finalist in the process and like the rest of the experience, was left dangling for weeks even after we discussed compensation, my start date, etc. I finally learned that they went with another candidate and was very disappointed with the entire experience. I would have expected much more for a company that prides itself on their reputation in the social media space."]
[u"LinkedIn used two initial phone screens (one with a recruiter, one with a hiring manager), followed by a day of interviews on site. I met with 7 different people on several different functional areas: research, development, and marketing. Interviews consisted of a mixture of several things: questions about my background and experience, case studies, and technical questions. Interviewers asked specific questions about LinkedIn's products, and asked for ideas on how to design and build these systems. I have never had as much fun interviewing with a company as I had with LinkedIn. I had a number of very intellectually interesting discussions. I also found that LinkedIn engineers were very friendly and outgoing; I got the sense that the goal of the interviews was as much to see if they wanted to work with you as it was to see if you could contribute technically. If you are interviewing with LinkedIn, you'll find it helpful to learn something about LinkedIn's products. You should definitely spend some time using different features on the LinkedIn web site (suggestions, groups, messages), and should also do some research on the company itself (magazine articles, open source software projects, etc)."]
[u'The work culture is very laid back, like any other startup.']
[u'Process was in the following order 1. Phone Screen with HR 2. Phone Screen with Director of Product 3. On-site interview with 5 individuals Interviews were driven by a specific over arching theme e.g. Increasing Sign-ups, UI redesign, Product Strategy and segmenting, Technical deep dive, Pricing Very professional and smart individuals, high energy reflected in their demeanor, very focused on solving the recruiting problem, always focused on monetizing the idea.']
[u'I had applied for the job from linkedin job postings. The recruiter called me and tooke 2 weeks to set up an phone interview. The interviewer, another senior software engineer, was prompt and described about the position and work done by his department. Asked question about algorithms and time complexity involved with with them and gave a problem and asked questions from my solution. It was hard to explain line by line program over the phone. This kind of interview should be done during 1:1 not over the phone']
[u'1. I got a call from the HR program showing interest 2. I had an interview with the Program Manager of the IT Group 3. I had a panel interview over Skype with few of the Engineers and Group Leader of the IT group - Very Helpful in answering questions - All the interviewers really liked the company - Sounded like an amazing company to work for']
[u'first round was good. Mostly graph theory, design questions on scalability and HA. LRUCache design.']
[u"Great interviewer with lots of great technical questions - and answers to go along when I did not know them. Wasn't a fit in the end, but we had a good conversation none the less."]
